# üìö BookFeels Emotion-Based Book Recommendation System
 
## ‚ú® Introduction
BookFeels is an emotion-driven book recommendation system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to suggest books based on the emotional tone extracted from their reviews.
Developed as a graduation project, it combines lexicon-based emotion detection, deep learning sentiment analysis, and a hybrid recommendation engine.

## üöÄ Features
- Emotion Detection from book reviews (happiness, sadness, excitement, etc.)

- Lexicon Expansion using WordNet to cover more emotional expressions

- Negation Handling (e.g., ‚Äúnot happy‚Äù ‚ûî interpreted as sad)

- Sentiment Analysis using pre-trained RoBERTa model (Twitter-roBERTa)

- A Hybrid Recommendation System combining emotions, book metadata, and ratings

- Modular Design for flexibility and customization

## üóÇ Dataset
- Book Reviews with titles, authors, categories, review texts, and ratings

- Preprocessing includes text cleaning, lemmatization, and negation handling

- Emotion Profiles are aggregated at the book level

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach
### Emotion Classification:
- Expand a base emotion lexicon using WordNet synonyms/antonyms, then detect emotions per review.

### Sentiment Analysis:
- Use CardiffNLP‚Äôs Twitter-RoBERTa to classify reviews as positive/neutral/negative.

### BERT Fine-Tuning (Experimental):
- Fine-tune BERT on Google‚Äôs GoEmotions dataset (27 emotion labels) to understand multi-label emotion classification.

## Recommendation Logic:

- TF-IDF vectorization of emotions, author, and genre

- Cosine similarity matching between user emotions and books

- Rating normalization with MinMaxScaler

- Final ranking combining similarity and rating

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Languages: Python 3.x

- Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn, transformers, torch

- Tools: Jupyter Notebooks

- Models: RoBERTa (for sentiment), experimental BERT (for emotions)
