       "      <td>70 years have passed since the first publication of &amp;quot;A Room of One's Own,&amp;quot; and yet we have not seen as many dramatic changes, let alone improvements, in social mentality as early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf wished to provoke to establish women's new role as equal to men's. She argued that the reason why there was no female Shakespeare is not that women are biologically inferior to men but that there was simply no &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; for women to develop themselves, both metaphorically and realistically speaking. Therefore, in this book she encourages women to have a room of their own and a stable income to ensure a career. However, women, in the past as well as the present, have long been &amp;quot;grounded&amp;quot; by men. For a woman to have a room of her own and a stable income means that the woman is invading (from male chauvinistic viewpoint) men's territory, and this kind of behavior (and thoughts) is not to be allowed in male-dominated societies.Early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided later generations with iron-cast proof (as far as I'm concerned) that women are no &amp;quot;second sex&amp;quot; by pointing out the false discriminations men put against women for men's own convenience. (Ironically, I see men suffer as well from doing so.) Thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided &amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot; to develop feminist thoughts, and these rooms also provoke controversies and debates because feminist way of thinking is revolutionary. At any rate, there would be no improvements of women's role in society if there were no Virginia Woolf and other first-wave feminist thinkers.At the end of the twentieth century, in spite of the burgeoning &amp;quot;industry&amp;quot; of feminism, the real condition of women appears to be quite depressing. The real condition of women goes like this: &amp;quot;During the last decades women's representation in education has grown enormously but so has our [their] participation in low paid and part-time work. So that, for example, the percentage of women in German higher education has doubled yet the degree of confidence German women express for women in non-traditional jobs is one of the lowest in Europe...,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;similarly feminist literary criticism has created a lively and substantial body of work in the last decades but continues to exist in a hostile and often marginal academic place.&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Feminist Literary Criticism&amp;quot;, 1994: 290) One cannot fail to see (if one is willing to open his or her eyes) that we have made just a tiny bit of progress since the first-wave feminism. There is room for improvement, indeed, but people's ignorance of women's real position in society, women's subordinate educational, economical, and political conditions, and the overall social status of women being secondary, must first be recognized. In this sense, Virginia Woolf's &amp;quot;A Room of One's Own&amp;quot; appears to be especially inspiring.In my opinion, feminism is not only for or about women, it is also for and about men, because the world is composed of both sexes, and men suffer (without understanding, because of stupidity) from the traditional, male chauvinistic attitude as well. What is important is that feminist way of thinking is a breakthrough, revolutionary philosophy that challenges the way we perceive the world for centuries. &amp;quot;A Room of One's Own&amp;quot; opens my mind's eye; it is, no doubt, a classic that must be read.</td>\n",

Without getting into a debate on the reasons why we went to Iraq or the reasons why we are still in Iraq it is none the less interesting to note the recruiting (and retention) crisis the military is experiencing in recent years. If being in Iraq and re-making the Middle East in our image is so important to our national security and well being on par with World War II and the Cold War as the neo-conservatives state, then our government should act the part. We need to have a draft where young men of draft age are eligible for a military draft. Not only should we draft our young men but we should draft our money as well in the forms of higer taxes a la WWII. Sadly Bush, the neo-cons and the American people know this won't sell. Even the most ardent Iraq War supporters would turn against it if they or their family members would be put in the line of fire. Before you are willing to kill you should be willing to die. Too many Americans are not.Bearing this context in mind you have an economic draft where those within our society are funneled into the military with over blown and often false promises of education, job skills, and most basically a job. I knew that the recruiters often made false and misleading promises to intice young men and women into the military. I did not know that a contract with the military is a contact where only one party is bound by the terms of the contract (you) and the other party can change the basic terms of the contract at will (the military). Would you enter into a contract with an employer, a partner, a bank or a contractor with such lop-sided terms such as these? Unfortuantely too many young Americans are doing just that. They do not have legal training in contract law to know what they are signing away when then sign the bottom line. Of course some people would chose to deny this fact and others while not openly admitting to this fact wouldn't care less due to the fact those that are trapped in these circumstances look different from them and come from the other side of the tracks.I could go on about the other reasons they mentioned but I will stick to this point. Two things I fault the book on is the fact they didn't mention that the military can call you back into service disrupting your life and career many years after your initial service to serve in a war you may not agree with. Another fact they failed to mention was the chicken-hawks (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, DeLay, Limbaugh et al) who are so eager to start wars but so hesitant to go to war themselves.Like I said read this book for youself and then decide. The Pentagon has a multi-million dollar budget to promote recruiting, why should it fear one book?Robert</td>\n",

       "0  70 years have passed since the first publication of &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; and yet we have not seen as many dramatic changes, let alone improvements, in social mentality as early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf wished to provoke to establish women's new role as equal to men's. She argued that the reason why there was no female Shakespeare is not that women are biologically inferior to men but that there was simply no &quot;room&quot; for women to develop themselves, both metaphorically and realistically speaking. Therefore, in this book she encourages women to have a room of their own and a stable income to ensure a career. However, women, in the past as well as the present, have long been &quot;grounded&quot; by men. For a woman to have a room of her own and a stable income means that the woman is invading (from male chauvinistic viewpoint) men's territory, and this kind of behavior (and thoughts) is not to be allowed in male-dominated societies.Early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided later generations with iron-cast proof (as far as I'm concerned) that women are no &quot;second sex&quot; by pointing out the false discriminations men put against women for men's own convenience. (Ironically, I see men suffer as well from doing so.) Thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided &quot;rooms&quot; to develop feminist thoughts, and these rooms also provoke controversies and debates because feminist way of thinking is revolutionary. At any rate, there would be no improvements of women's role in society if there were no Virginia Woolf and other first-wave feminist thinkers.At the end of the twentieth century, in spite of the burgeoning &quot;industry&quot; of feminism, the real condition of women appears to be quite depressing. The real condition of women goes like this: &quot;During the last decades women's representation in education has grown enormously but so has our [their] participation in low paid and part-time work. So that, for example, the percentage of women in German higher education has doubled yet the degree of confidence German women express for women in non-traditional jobs is one of the lowest in Europe...,&quot; and &quot;similarly feminist literary criticism has created a lively and substantial body of work in the last decades but continues to exist in a hostile and often marginal academic place.&quot; (&quot;A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Feminist Literary Criticism&quot;, 1994: 290) One cannot fail to see (if one is willing to open his or her eyes) that we have made just a tiny bit of progress since the first-wave feminism. There is room for improvement, indeed, but people's ignorance of women's real position in society, women's subordinate educational, economical, and political conditions, and the overall social status of women being secondary, must first be recognized. In this sense, Virginia Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; appears to be especially inspiring.In my opinion, feminism is not only for or about women, it is also for and about men, because the world is composed of both sexes, and men suffer (without understanding, because of stupidity) from the traditional, male chauvinistic attitude as well. What is important is that feminist way of thinking is a breakthrough, revolutionary philosophy that challenges the way we perceive the world for centuries. &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; opens my mind's eye; it is, no doubt, a classic that must be read.   \n",

Without getting into a debate on the reasons why we went to Iraq or the reasons why we are still in Iraq it is none the less interesting to note the recruiting (and retention) crisis the military is experiencing in recent years. If being in Iraq and re-making the Middle East in our image is so important to our national security and well being on par with World War II and the Cold War as the neo-conservatives state, then our government should act the part. We need to have a draft where young men of draft age are eligible for a military draft. Not only should we draft our young men but we should draft our money as well in the forms of higer taxes a la WWII. Sadly Bush, the neo-cons and the American people know this won't sell. Even the most ardent Iraq War supporters would turn against it if they or their family members would be put in the line of fire. Before you are willing to kill you should be willing to die. Too many Americans are not.Bearing this context in mind you have an economic draft where those within our society are funneled into the military with over blown and often false promises of education, job skills, and most basically a job. I knew that the recruiters often made false and misleading promises to intice young men and women into the military. I did not know that a contract with the military is a contact where only one party is bound by the terms of the contract (you) and the other party can change the basic terms of the contract at will (the military). Would you enter into a contract with an employer, a partner, a bank or a contractor with such lop-sided terms such as these? Unfortuantely too many young Americans are doing just that. They do not have legal training in contract law to know what they are signing away when then sign the bottom line. Of course some people would chose to deny this fact and others while not openly admitting to this fact wouldn't care less due to the fact those that are trapped in these circumstances look different from them and come from the other side of the tracks.I could go on about the other reasons they mentioned but I will stick to this point. Two things I fault the book on is the fact they didn't mention that the military can call you back into service disrupting your life and career many years after your initial service to serve in a war you may not agree with. Another fact they failed to mention was the chicken-hawks (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, DeLay, Limbaugh et al) who are so eager to start wars but so hesitant to go to war themselves.Like I said read this book for youself and then decide. The Pentagon has a multi-million dollar budget to promote recruiting, why should it fear one book?Robert   \n",

Steinbeck has a fluidity to paint with words, to illustrate the subjects, their emotions and their settings with such tenacious cadence that, although it sounds clich&eacute;, one feels as if he/she is there.This particular novel is about many different characters living in a city near San Francisco and follows some of the moments in their lives. What is timeless and splendid about the stories is how they come together and intertwine, and how the characters interact.Pick this book up if you want to go for an imaginary vacation to the Northern coasts of California 50 years into the past....   \n",

He uses metaphors and beautifully written prose instead of complicated, dull, discursive, scientific jargon. Instead of describing this subject from a strictly left brain approach his writing is from a whole brain perspective appealing to both the artist (or in my case musician) and the scientist. He takes physics to the brink of philosophy and beyond in an effort to describe the physics of the universe in spiritual terms. I tried to read _A Brief History of Time_ by Stephen Hawking a few years ago and didn't get past chapter four. After the education I received from Zukav in _Wu Li_, I was able to read and comprehend almost all of _A Brief History of Time_. Give it a try   \n",

The story of two young and love struck individuals with a war all around them, and all they have is each other. Truly one of the greatest and most demanding books you'll ever read, the story not only involves the reader, but makes you feel for and with the characters and the ending which is the climax and best part of the book is indeed an emotional strain and feel for the characters. I'll even dare to say you'll enjoy every page of this book, because I know I did. The beginning is a bit slow but still very engaging and different events and characters only add to the splendor of the work. Indeed this is a very good and well-written novel, and I openly say that there would be no regret if you were to read this book, a novel that pleasantly surprised me and for that, I enjoyed it greatly.   \n",

       "      <td>In a complex, lusty tale of feuding Scottish clans during the time of James IV of Scotland and Henry VIII of England, Henley serves up a story that will grab you from the first page and will not let you go. I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list!

She is aware of the situation that she is in but her passion for life and her faith in people displays her innocence and the fact that she is so young.I was fascinated by the way she obviously matured through the years that she was hiding and completely horrified by some of the topics that she was dealing with in her diary.A very good book.</td>\n",

I hadn't read it in years, and found it just as enthralling as it was over thirty years ago.But I was surprised at how difficult it was to ignore the presence of the Red Bull...I mean, the energy drink, which kept diluting the serious and mysterious fear due to Haggard's bull. I've come to terms with my last name, and the connotations recent acquaintances attach to me because of it, but I was sad that such a great piece of literature had been sullied by a cultural phenomenon.   \n",

       "2  In a complex, lusty tale of feuding Scottish clans during the time of James IV of Scotland and Henry VIII of England, Henley serves up a story that will grab you from the first page and will not let you go. I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list! The second in the 2-book Clan Kennedy Saga is THE BORDER HOSTAGE.   \n",

The only interesting character is Lady Bret Ashley, and this is only because she is so pretensious and dull witted that it brought out a severe hatred in me.Good writing style but not much doing here otherwise. I wish this generation would stay lost, they're very, very boring.   \n",

She is aware of the situation that she is in but her passion for life and her faith in people displays her innocence and the fact that she is so young.I was fascinated by the way she obviously matured through the years that she was hiding and completely horrified by some of the topics that she was dealing with in her diary.A very good book.   \n",

I hadn't read it in years, and found it just as enthralling as it was over thirty years ago.But I was surprised at how difficult it was to ignore the presence of the Red Bull...I mean, the energy drink, which kept diluting the serious and mysterious fear due to Haggard's bull. I've come to terms with my last name, and the connotations recent acquaintances attach to me because of it, but I was sad that such a great piece of literature had been sullied by a cultural phenomenon.   \n",

I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list! The second in the 2-book Clan Kennedy Saga is THE BORDER HOSTAGE.   \n",

The only interesting character is Lady Bret Ashley, and this is only because she is so pretensious and dull witted that it brought out a severe hatred in me.Good writing style but not much doing here otherwise. I wish this generation would stay lost, they're very, very boring.   \n",

She is aware of the situation that she is in but her passion for life and her faith in people displays her innocence and the fact that she is so young.I was fascinated by the way she obviously matured through the years that she was hiding and completely horrified by some of the topics that she was dealing with in her diary.A very good book.   \n",

Patrick Dearen has written an instant classic that deserves a place on anyone's list of Best Western Novels.\" -- D. R. Meredith, Roundup Magazine of Western Writers of America.\"Admirable . . . a powerful novel reminiscent of Edward Abbey's `The Brave Cowboy' . . . . Excellent.\" -- Dallas Morning News.\"The tale of . . . a cowboy born a century too late . . . . Bright and poignant . . . . A sharply drawn and memorable novel.\" -- Dale Walker, Rocky Mountain News.\"Departs intriguingly from classic western form . . . . A tale of a cowboy born 100 years too late and of his desperate run from the law.\" -- Publishers Weekly.\"A spellbinding tale of the modern world against the last cowboy.\" -- San Angelo Standard-Times.\"Pits one man's nineteenth century dreams against another man's twentieth century reality.\" -- Books of the Southwest.\"The last cowboy in our modern world decides to risk his life by stealing a horse and escaping to the Colorado Divide where he can live as cowboys did a hundred years ago . . . . Inspired by an actual horseback-helicopter manhunt in Texas . . . .

[Dearen's] skills . . . argue for the survival of America's most fascinating and probably only authentic myth.\" -- Texas Books in Review.\"A modern chase novel that pits cutting-edge technology against a lone cowboy. It sounds like a complete mismatch--and it is, though not in exactly the way one might think.\" -- recommended reading list, What Do I Read Next?, 1995 edition.\"The story of a modern-day cowboy who is determined to live or die by the cowboy code . . . . The reader can almost hear the serenades of the crickets, cicadas, and coyotes. You will want to read this book even if you don't normally read westerns.\" -- Austin American-Statesman.\"Patrick Dearen . . . is of the [Elmer] Kelton School . . . . The story gains color and character from [Dearen's] incredible 74 interviews with men who took up cowboying between 1899 and 1931.\" -- Kent Biffle, Dallas Morning-News.\"If you're a western fan and have only $20 to spend in the bookstore this year, spend it on `When Cowboys Die.' And when you close the book, step outside and look toward the west and whisper, `Keep on riding, Charlie--for all of us.'\" -- Amarillo Sunday Globe-News.   \n",

However one of the stories, the \"Lamia in the Cevernnes\" is really wonderful and creepy.The volume of short stories, \"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\" also had uneven quality but contained one of the finest novellas in the English lanuage, the piece from which the volume gets its name.I sometimes think of A.S. Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft.Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level.   \n",

I can truly say that &quot;He Knows Whereof He Speaks.&quot; This book will do your relationship as much good as &quot;Men are from Mars, Women From Venus,&quot; perhaps more, and will be a lot easier to read. In fact, because of its extreme readability (all blank pages) the men in your lives, Sisters, will be able to finish it during the first commercial of the Super Bowl! Read on!   \n",

This book was a departure. I think there were too many gizmo, wizbang, gee-whiz kind of toys in this novel. The characters never really had to stretch themselves to accomplish anything, because the technology did it all for them.The other thing I kept having trouble with was the character of Charlie. If he was a Marine Sniper in Vietnam and the book is set in about 2020, then Charlie would be pushing 70+ years. It just didn't hold together.However, if you walk away from the need for a realistic, techno thriller and look at the book as Sci Fi, well it isn't too bad. The gadgets are kind of kool when you look at it this way, although, the characters need some work.   \n",

Actually, Lewis Carroll was a very smart man. He invented Wonderland to show people truths in their own world most people wouldn't even bother thinking about. In fact, I think the whole point of the book is that even though Wonderland seems so unreal and full of nonsence, it's really just the same as our own world! I admit, I was curious about what a book so popular written for children would be like. It was great! I'd recomend it to anyone!   \n",
      "16  The slim pages of Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad contain a surprise: three books for the price of one! The only problem is that none of these books is particularly good.The first book lurking in Rich Dad, Poor Dad would have made a nice pamphlet, or about 20 powerpoint slides, describing the author's financial philosophy. Some Kiyosaki's sound bites are on target(Americans need more financial education; working for your self is empowering; it's a good idea to acquire assets that generate positive cash flow), some are provocative (a house should be considered a liability, not an asset), and some are downright loopy (\"pay yourself first\", even when you don't have enough to pay your bills, so that angry creditors make you work harder). Right or wrong, the basic ideas are all worth thinking about.But you can't charge much for a pamphlet, so this thin layer of material is padded out to fill a second book, which strains to reach 195 pages of random transitions and endless repetition. It's a bit like being stuck next to a talkative but slightly drunk businessman for six hours on a plane. You don't need to worry about missing anything, because you're going to hear it again.Just one example:\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\" (p. 59).\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average perion, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\" (p. 61).Yes, folks, that's a mere two pages apart. And it's hardly an aberration in this book. You have to wonder what co-author Sharon Lechter and the editor of this book did for their paychecks besides press \"play\" on the tape recorder.The third book contained in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the most interesting--and most disturbing. It's hard to tell how seriously to take the backstory behind the author's financial genius--one suspects a lot of embellishment to serve the clever title. Still, there is an alarming genuineness to Kiyosaki's repeated trashings of his real father, whom he alternately refers to as his \"educated dad\" or \"poor dad\". This fellow seems to have enjoyed a successful career as a teacher, government official and union leader (and supposedly acquired enough assets to be subject to the estate tax--not bad for a \"poor\" dad). Nevertheless, his son views him as a pathetic failure compared to his \"rich dad\", the entrepreneur-speculator father of his best friend. This vaguely drawn figure (perhaps based on a real person) gives Kiyosaki some helpful advice at a young age, but there's nothing to elevate him to \"dad\" status--other than Kiyosaki's all-too-real loathing of his own father. Kiyosaki's own raging insecurities (centered on his lack of educational attainments and paternal disapproval of his career path) take center stage in this Oedipal drama. This part of the book gave me the creeps.   \n",

When I saw by accident that this book was on sale, I bought it. I thought it started slowly - just as life in English countryside in the 1930s must have been slow and unhurried. We meet the young veterinarian who also narrates the story when his practice just begins and with him we get to know \"all creatures great and small\" whom he meets, helps to get better when he can or helps to end their sufferings when he can't. I thought this book was full of love in the best way and very well written.   \n",

It'll be interesting to get my half-German daughter to read it. At any rate: teenagers, surplus rocket ship, Nazis, moon landing.

Jim Collins academic background is very apparent in his approach. It is refreshing to see a more rigorous approach, compared to many other books that are based on personal experience, intuition, and opinion. Highyl recommended.   \n",

A boy from Texas or so, comes to a different state. Why? Because of his dad's job. They always moved around. So this guy meets Beatrice because he always had to see another guy run barefoot super fast. Beatrice told him to stay away but he couldn't. He was just so amazed by his speed, and he didn't even go to school. So this boy couldn't stay away, well he didn't until he met him. His \"name\" was Butterfingers because he caught these small fish with his bare hands. He was hiding from his parents because he was \"bad,\" he was rebellious. Beatrice & Butterfingers were brother and sister, so she helped him hide. They were trying to avoid the construction of a new pancake house in the place where baby owls lived underground. The people from the pancake house (meaning the boss) knew about these owls, but he still wanted that place. Well, I've said enough. Find out how it ends by reading this book, because there is alot to learn from it. Well at least that's what I think, and I think that this book teaches people to stand up for the little guys. I recommend this book to people who care about the enviroment.   \n",

I have to say, I really enjoyed the first book \"Eye of the World\". The way the story developed and the characters was fascinating and I was sucked in. About halfway through this second book things.....began....to....slow...way....down. I don't know if I am just tired of following of the same story or if Jordan's writing pace is just wearing me down. I enjoy in depth character studies....but usually only when it pertains to characters who will be focused on throughout the story, Jordan seems to give even the bit players a lengthy description. Also, I am beginning to suspect that almost any storyline involving the main characters; Perrin, Mat, Rand, Loial etc..are beginning to lose the tension the first book held because I don't think Jordan will let any real harm come to them in these first few books. So, when Mat's life seems in danger midway through the book, I don't feel the urgent need to read on because I already know he will survive. I don't know how...just that Jordan doesn't seem willing to kill off one of his main characters. Also, I hope that Jordan will begin to populate his novels with average looking or ugly people. So far everyone who happens along is exceedingly beautiful or strikingly handsome. I was kind of hoping Rand would be described as looking like Clint Howard just to balance things off. Still this isn't a bad book, but I don't think it lives up to the promise of the \"Eye of the World\". The action and climax of this book is very good once you get there, but be warned, you don't want to start this series here, you would be completely lost.   \n",

I've never come across the spelling distraction to this extent before, I don't appreciate the read nearly as much as usual on my Kindle. Am I the only one this has happened to?   \n",

Read it now so you too can see the beauty of what a little hard boiled egg and a slice of ham could mean to someone.It might taste differently to you after reading this classic memoir.   \n",
      "25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Reading these reviews for such a wonderful tale, I was struck by the profusion of slights to the tedious style employed by the author. Now, I thought this was a fact anyone reading the book would have known from prior knowledge, but I guess not: Gaston Leroux was not an Englishman! His story is not tediously, almost boringly written, the English translation from the original French is! When transferring a work of literature from one language to the other, it is necessary to make concessions to the cadence and stylistic idioms of the adopted language, thus necessitating a change in form and style, since a verbatim translation is a thing practically impossible to obtain, particularly when translating from a Romance language (like French) to a Germanic language (like English.) Consider this: would one expect Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, if translated into another language such as French or German, to retain the poetic gravity that it possesses in its native English? Works of literature are written to conform to the rules, and indeed beauty, of the writer's native tongue, and therefore only retain their true beauty in that language. The phrase \"lost in translation\" reserves more pertinence here than anywhere else! Oftentimes a difference in translator can make the diferentiation between a good work and a great one (for proof of this phenomenon, compare the Norman MacAffee translation of Hugo's Les Miserables to that of Wilbour)but since relatively few translations of Phantom exist, we shall have to read that with which we are provided and merely speculate (unless the reader is fluent or at least conversational in French) at the beauty these words possessed in their native tongue!As for the novel itself, I\"d highly recommend its reading, and that is not just because I am an avid aficionado of French literature but, as I am myself a writer, because I recognize worthy literature when i read it. It is indeed refreshing to see the story of the Phantom as it was originally intended, before being heavily romanticized by Weber, and then Schumacher. For a fairly true-to-the-novel film adaptation, I'd suggest the 1926 silent film starring Lon Chaney. Adieu!   \n",

I'm not a big fan of spy books but if I have to drudge my way through one, this one would be it. It's pretty fast passed and easy reading. It keeps you confussed engough that you want to keep on reading. What I didn't like was that it seemed to forced. The charaters, the side love plot, a lot of the feelings and emotions expressed through the book, just didn't seem like they had to be there. It seemed like LeCarre just thought &quot;it's a spy book, so I HAVE TO have this in it...&quot;. It would have been better if LeCarre had completely broken away from the stereotypical spy book as it seemed he was trying so hard to do.   \n",

It was difficult to keep track of all of the characters. The 468 pages were devoted mostly to lengthy descriptions about each characters clothes or body features.As a relatively recent reader of this genre, I found the whole Sidhe/Fey/Faere/Goblin/Brownie culture difficult to understand. Hamilton didn't provide enough information to help me separate each unique culture and then see their inter-relationships.I hope that Hamilton rescues my waivering trust and salvages the storyline in A Caress of Twilight.   \n",

As a survivor of domestic violence and child abuse, for over 20 years, I can certainly relate to the book. I have also been working in the field for quite a few years. I hope Dr. Dutton will be lecturing nearby, because I would love to meet him in person and hear more about updates in his research. Not enough is being done to understand batterers or to figure out the best way to work with them. Instead of people complaining about his book or any other (on batterers), they should appreciate the fact someone has given a darn about this issue. After all, what are you doing? You can find my thesis in my book Absent Hearts, Missing Pieces which is available through Amazon as well. You might find the final chapter a bit controversial though!   \n",

It is a beautifully crafted story, well-written and full of poignant moments. The richness of the plot had me hooked from early on, and surprisingly, it just kept getting better with each page. I hated to put it down! The nuances of the relationships in the book were fascinating and made the characters truly alive for me, often giving me a lot to think about even when I wasn't reading. This is a book I will encourage all my friends to borrow!   \n",

       "      <td>In a complex, lusty tale of feuding Scottish clans during the time of James IV of Scotland and Henry VIII of England, Henley serves up a story that will grab you from the first page and will not let you go. I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list!

However one of the stories, the \"Lamia in the Cevernnes\" is really wonderful and creepy.The volume of short stories, \"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\" also had uneven quality but contained one of the finest novellas in the English lanuage, the piece from which the volume gets its name.I sometimes think of A.S. Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft.Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The slim pages of Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad contain a surprise: three books for the price of one! The only problem is that none of these books is particularly good.The first book lurking in Rich Dad, Poor Dad would have made a nice pamphlet, or about 20 powerpoint slides, describing the author's financial philosophy. Some Kiyosaki's sound bites are on target(Americans need more financial education; working for your self is empowering; it's a good idea to acquire assets that generate positive cash flow), some are provocative (a house should be considered a liability, not an asset), and some are downright loopy (\"pay yourself first\", even when you don't have enough to pay your bills, so that angry creditors make you work harder). Right or wrong, the basic ideas are all worth thinking about.But you can't charge much for a pamphlet, so this thin layer of material is padded out to fill a second book, which strains to reach 195 pages of random transitions and endless repetition. It's a bit like being stuck next to a talkative but slightly drunk businessman for six hours on a plane. You don't need to worry about missing anything, because you're going to hear it again.Just one example:\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\" (p. 59).\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average perion, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\" (p. 61).Yes, folks, that's a mere two pages apart. And it's hardly an aberration in this book. You have to wonder what co-author Sharon Lechter and the editor of this book did for their paychecks besides press \"play\" on the tape recorder.The third book contained in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the most interesting--and most disturbing. It's hard to tell how seriously to take the backstory behind the author's financial genius--one suspects a lot of embellishment to serve the clever title. Still, there is an alarming genuineness to Kiyosaki's repeated trashings of his real father, whom he alternately refers to as his \"educated dad\" or \"poor dad\". This fellow seems to have enjoyed a successful career as a teacher, government official and union leader (and supposedly acquired enough assets to be subject to the estate tax--not bad for a \"poor\" dad). Nevertheless, his son views him as a pathetic failure compared to his \"rich dad\", the entrepreneur-speculator father of his best friend. This vaguely drawn figure (perhaps based on a real person) gives Kiyosaki some helpful advice at a young age, but there's nothing to elevate him to \"dad\" status--other than Kiyosaki's all-too-real loathing of his own father. Kiyosaki's own raging insecurities (centered on his lack of educational attainments and paternal disapproval of his career path) take center stage in this Oedipal drama. This part of the book gave me the creeps.</td>\n",

I hadn't read it in years, and found it just as enthralling as it was over thirty years ago.But I was surprised at how difficult it was to ignore the presence of the Red Bull...I mean, the energy drink, which kept diluting the serious and mysterious fear due to Haggard's bull. I've come to terms with my last name, and the connotations recent acquaintances attach to me because of it, but I was sad that such a great piece of literature had been sullied by a cultural phenomenon.   \n",

I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list! The second in the 2-book Clan Kennedy Saga is THE BORDER HOSTAGE.   \n",

The only interesting character is Lady Bret Ashley, and this is only because she is so pretensious and dull witted that it brought out a severe hatred in me.Good writing style but not much doing here otherwise. I wish this generation would stay lost, they're very, very boring.   \n",

She is aware of the situation that she is in but her passion for life and her faith in people displays her innocence and the fact that she is so young.I was fascinated by the way she obviously matured through the years that she was hiding and completely horrified by some of the topics that she was dealing with in her diary.A very good book.   \n",

Patrick Dearen has written an instant classic that deserves a place on anyone's list of Best Western Novels.\" -- D. R. Meredith, Roundup Magazine of Western Writers of America.\"Admirable . . . a powerful novel reminiscent of Edward Abbey's `The Brave Cowboy' . . . . Excellent.\" -- Dallas Morning News.\"The tale of . . . a cowboy born a century too late . . . . Bright and poignant . . . . A sharply drawn and memorable novel.\" -- Dale Walker, Rocky Mountain News.\"Departs intriguingly from classic western form . . . . A tale of a cowboy born 100 years too late and of his desperate run from the law.\" -- Publishers Weekly.\"A spellbinding tale of the modern world against the last cowboy.\" -- San Angelo Standard-Times.\"Pits one man's nineteenth century dreams against another man's twentieth century reality.\" -- Books of the Southwest.\"The last cowboy in our modern world decides to risk his life by stealing a horse and escaping to the Colorado Divide where he can live as cowboys did a hundred years ago . . . . Inspired by an actual horseback-helicopter manhunt in Texas . . . .

[Dearen's] skills . . . argue for the survival of America's most fascinating and probably only authentic myth.\" -- Texas Books in Review.\"A modern chase novel that pits cutting-edge technology against a lone cowboy. It sounds like a complete mismatch--and it is, though not in exactly the way one might think.\" -- recommended reading list, What Do I Read Next?, 1995 edition.\"The story of a modern-day cowboy who is determined to live or die by the cowboy code . . . . The reader can almost hear the serenades of the crickets, cicadas, and coyotes. You will want to read this book even if you don't normally read westerns.\" -- Austin American-Statesman.\"Patrick Dearen . . . is of the [Elmer] Kelton School . . . . The story gains color and character from [Dearen's] incredible 74 interviews with men who took up cowboying between 1899 and 1931.\" -- Kent Biffle, Dallas Morning-News.\"If you're a western fan and have only $20 to spend in the bookstore this year, spend it on `When Cowboys Die.' And when you close the book, step outside and look toward the west and whisper, `Keep on riding, Charlie--for all of us.'\" -- Amarillo Sunday Globe-News.   \n",

However one of the stories, the \"Lamia in the Cevernnes\" is really wonderful and creepy.The volume of short stories, \"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\" also had uneven quality but contained one of the finest novellas in the English lanuage, the piece from which the volume gets its name.I sometimes think of A.S. Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft.Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level.   \n",

I can truly say that &quot;He Knows Whereof He Speaks.&quot; This book will do your relationship as much good as &quot;Men are from Mars, Women From Venus,&quot; perhaps more, and will be a lot easier to read. In fact, because of its extreme readability (all blank pages) the men in your lives, Sisters, will be able to finish it during the first commercial of the Super Bowl! Read on!   \n",

This book was a departure. I think there were too many gizmo, wizbang, gee-whiz kind of toys in this novel. The characters never really had to stretch themselves to accomplish anything, because the technology did it all for them.The other thing I kept having trouble with was the character of Charlie. If he was a Marine Sniper in Vietnam and the book is set in about 2020, then Charlie would be pushing 70+ years. It just didn't hold together.However, if you walk away from the need for a realistic, techno thriller and look at the book as Sci Fi, well it isn't too bad. The gadgets are kind of kool when you look at it this way, although, the characters need some work.   \n",

Actually, Lewis Carroll was a very smart man. He invented Wonderland to show people truths in their own world most people wouldn't even bother thinking about. In fact, I think the whole point of the book is that even though Wonderland seems so unreal and full of nonsence, it's really just the same as our own world! I admit, I was curious about what a book so popular written for children would be like. It was great! I'd recomend it to anyone!   \n",
       "16  The slim pages of Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad contain a surprise: three books for the price of one! The only problem is that none of these books is particularly good.The first book lurking in Rich Dad, Poor Dad would have made a nice pamphlet, or about 20 powerpoint slides, describing the author's financial philosophy. Some Kiyosaki's sound bites are on target(Americans need more financial education; working for your self is empowering; it's a good idea to acquire assets that generate positive cash flow), some are provocative (a house should be considered a liability, not an asset), and some are downright loopy (\"pay yourself first\", even when you don't have enough to pay your bills, so that angry creditors make you work harder). Right or wrong, the basic ideas are all worth thinking about.But you can't charge much for a pamphlet, so this thin layer of material is padded out to fill a second book, which strains to reach 195 pages of random transitions and endless repetition. It's a bit like being stuck next to a talkative but slightly drunk businessman for six hours on a plane. You don't need to worry about missing anything, because you're going to hear it again.Just one example:\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\" (p. 59).\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average perion, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\" (p. 61).Yes, folks, that's a mere two pages apart. And it's hardly an aberration in this book. You have to wonder what co-author Sharon Lechter and the editor of this book did for their paychecks besides press \"play\" on the tape recorder.The third book contained in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the most interesting--and most disturbing. It's hard to tell how seriously to take the backstory behind the author's financial genius--one suspects a lot of embellishment to serve the clever title. Still, there is an alarming genuineness to Kiyosaki's repeated trashings of his real father, whom he alternately refers to as his \"educated dad\" or \"poor dad\". This fellow seems to have enjoyed a successful career as a teacher, government official and union leader (and supposedly acquired enough assets to be subject to the estate tax--not bad for a \"poor\" dad). Nevertheless, his son views him as a pathetic failure compared to his \"rich dad\", the entrepreneur-speculator father of his best friend. This vaguely drawn figure (perhaps based on a real person) gives Kiyosaki some helpful advice at a young age, but there's nothing to elevate him to \"dad\" status--other than Kiyosaki's all-too-real loathing of his own father. Kiyosaki's own raging insecurities (centered on his lack of educational attainments and paternal disapproval of his career path) take center stage in this Oedipal drama. This part of the book gave me the creeps.   \n",

When I saw by accident that this book was on sale, I bought it. I thought it started slowly - just as life in English countryside in the 1930s must have been slow and unhurried. We meet the young veterinarian who also narrates the story when his practice just begins and with him we get to know \"all creatures great and small\" whom he meets, helps to get better when he can or helps to end their sufferings when he can't. I thought this book was full of love in the best way and very well written.   \n",

It'll be interesting to get my half-German daughter to read it. At any rate: teenagers, surplus rocket ship, Nazis, moon landing.

       "      <td>In a complex, lusty tale of feuding Scottish clans during the time of James IV of Scotland and Henry VIII of England, Henley serves up a story that will grab you from the first page and will not let you go. I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list!

Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft.Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The slim pages of Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad contain a surprise: three books for the price of one! The only problem is that none of these books is particularly good.The first book lurking in Rich Dad, Poor Dad would have made a nice pamphlet, or about 20 powerpoint slides, describing the author's financial philosophy. Some Kiyosaki's sound bites are on target(Americans need more financial education; working for your self is empowering; it's a good idea to acquire assets that generate positive cash flow), some are provocative (a house should be considered a liability, not an asset), and some are downright loopy (\"pay yourself first\", even when you don't have enough to pay your bills, so that angry creditors make you work harder). Right or wrong, the basic ideas are all worth thinking about.But you can't charge much for a pamphlet, so this thin layer of material is padded out to fill a second book, which strains to reach 195 pages of random transitions and endless repetition. It's a bit like being stuck next to a talkative but slightly drunk businessman for six hours on a plane. You don't need to worry about missing anything, because you're going to hear it again.Just one example:\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\" (p. 59).\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average perion, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\" (p. 61).Yes, folks, that's a mere two pages apart. And it's hardly an aberration in this book. You have to wonder what co-author Sharon Lechter and the editor of this book did for their paychecks besides press \"play\" on the tape recorder.The third book contained in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the most interesting--and most disturbing. It's hard to tell how seriously to take the backstory behind the author's financial genius--one suspects a lot of embellishment to serve the clever title. Still, there is an alarming genuineness to Kiyosaki's repeated trashings of his real father, whom he alternately refers to as his \"educated dad\" or \"poor dad\". This fellow seems to have enjoyed a successful career as a teacher, government official and union leader (and supposedly acquired enough assets to be subject to the estate tax--not bad for a \"poor\" dad). Nevertheless, his son views him as a pathetic failure compared to his \"rich dad\", the entrepreneur-speculator father of his best friend. This vaguely drawn figure (perhaps based on a real person) gives Kiyosaki some helpful advice at a young age, but there's nothing to elevate him to \"dad\" status--other than Kiyosaki's all-too-real loathing of his own father. Kiyosaki's own raging insecurities (centered on his lack of educational attainments and paternal disapproval of his career path) take center stage in this Oedipal drama.

I have to say, I really enjoyed the first book \"Eye of the World\". The way the story developed and the characters was fascinating and I was sucked in. About halfway through this second book things.....began....to....slow...way....down. I don't know if I am just tired of following of the same story or if Jordan's writing pace is just wearing me down. I enjoy in depth character studies....but usually only when it pertains to characters who will be focused on throughout the story, Jordan seems to give even the bit players a lengthy description. Also, I am beginning to suspect that almost any storyline involving the main characters; Perrin, Mat, Rand, Loial etc..are beginning to lose the tension the first book held because I don't think Jordan will let any real harm come to them in these first few books. So, when Mat's life seems in danger midway through the book, I don't feel the urgent need to read on because I already know he will survive. I don't know how...just that Jordan doesn't seem willing to kill off one of his main characters. Also, I hope that Jordan will begin to populate his novels with average looking or ugly people. So far everyone who happens along is exceedingly beautiful or strikingly handsome. I was kind of hoping Rand would be described as looking like Clint Howard just to balance things off. Still this isn't a bad book, but I don't think it lives up to the promise of the \"Eye of the World\". The action and climax of this book is very good once you get there, but be warned, you don't want to start this series here, you would be completely lost.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Reading these reviews for such a wonderful tale, I was struck by the profusion of slights to the tedious style employed by the author. Now, I thought this was a fact anyone reading the book would have known from prior knowledge, but I guess not: Gaston Leroux was not an Englishman! His story is not tediously, almost boringly written, the English translation from the original French is! When transferring a work of literature from one language to the other, it is necessary to make concessions to the cadence and stylistic idioms of the adopted language, thus necessitating a change in form and style, since a verbatim translation is a thing practically impossible to obtain, particularly when translating from a Romance language (like French) to a Germanic language (like English.) Consider this: would one expect Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, if translated into another language such as French or German, to retain the poetic gravity that it possesses in its native English? Works of literature are written to conform to the rules, and indeed beauty, of the writer's native tongue, and therefore only retain their true beauty in that language. The phrase \"lost in translation\" reserves more pertinence here than anywhere else! Oftentimes a difference in translator can make the diferentiation between a good work and a great one (for proof of this phenomenon, compare the Norman MacAffee translation of Hugo's Les Miserables to that of Wilbour)but since relatively few translations of Phantom exist, we shall have to read that with which we are provided and merely speculate (unless the reader is fluent or at least conversational in French) at the beauty these words possessed in their native tongue!As for the novel itself, I\"d highly recommend its reading, and that is not just because I am an avid aficionado of French literature but, as I am myself a writer, because I recognize worthy literature when i read it. It is indeed refreshing to see the story of the Phantom as it was originally intended, before being heavily romanticized by Weber, and then Schumacher. For a fairly true-to-the-novel film adaptation, I'd suggest the 1926 silent film starring Lon Chaney. Adieu!</td>\n",

This is the &amp;quot;classic western novel&amp;quot; that everyone has been raving about? &amp;quot;Shane&amp;quot; lacks the elements of a good story almost completely. There is frighteningly little character development, and I find it a little strange that the reader knows next to nothing about the title character. Since other reviwers have already mentioned that pretty much nothing happens in this book, I will focus on the lack of information about Shane. The only concrete fact about Shane is that he has a mysterious past. Anything else that might be said about him is inferred,(as are most traits attributed to members of the Starrett family). Also, I believe that Schaefer pushed the whole &amp;quot;Shane's past haunts him&amp;quot; thing a little too far. The reader is constantly reminded of how &amp;quot;poor Shane had something bad happen to him&amp;quot;. This started to get old about 30 pgs in, and to add insult to injury, we are never told exactly what this &amp;quot;bad thing&amp;quot; was. Within literature it is sometimes for the best to leave things ambiguous, but usually, the piece of information that is never going to be told to the reader is not hinted at and/or alluded to every other page. It seemed to me that Shane's past was a vital part... scratch that, one of the only parts of his overall character. Ultimately, reading this book felt like watching the sequal to a movie I'd never seen, mostly because of the huge gaps in information about the characters. Without interesting characters, even a story with excellent prose and plot can fall flat. Shane, which had neither of these to begin with, was utterly dissapointing.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What can be told about Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test? It's a reporting of the Merry Pranksters and their whacked-out, drug addled misadventures across the country with Ken Kesey as their assumed and humble leader. While overall, I was not a big fan of this book, I should not continue without saying that there are some truly entertaining stories to be told here (Kesey's first experience with acid and the \"buddha\", Kesey meeting Owsley, experiences with the Dead, etc.). In fact, I wouldn't even necessarily not recommend it. I say this because I don't think the problems that I have with this book would bother the average reader.Having said this, I think that I just see this book as being moot. It's a story told about acidheads, from a person who never actually tried any acid. Anyone who has tried this psychedelic drug will try to explain it's significance to you, but will ultimately admit that it transcends words and it must simply be experienced (unintentional nod to Hendrix). Now, this could potentially not matter (and who would want to read the ramblings of a tripper anyhow?), but a sort of US V THEM scenario is created as a result. The \"us\" being Wolfe and the reader, and the \"them\" being the subjects of the book. The author, therefore the reader, seemingly stick out like a sore thumb in a style of book in which the reader is supposed to feel immersed in the time and place. If you want to hear an account of a Phish concert, do you want to hear it from the parents who have brought their 16 year old son to his first concert whilst sitting in the back row covering their mouths with handkerchiefs as to avoid inhaling any marijuana smoke, or do you want to hear from the guy near the front who has created an open space for himself from the reeling of fellow concert goers as to avoid the flailing limbs of his frantic dance? I know my answer.However, the fatal flaw for me, which may not bother anyone else is that the appeal of the subject matter seemed to diminish as time went on. The book maintained a level of interest in me that was equal the number of pages I held in my right hand. I went from the wide-eyed curiosity of the examination of a group of people determined to change the world, to being bored and kind of angry that a group of drug-addled hedonists had garnered so much attention. They contributed nothing to society, other than proving that simply TALKING ABOUT changing the world won't amount to anything if you simply lie around and trip out and screw each other all day. My interest in this book was a perfect metaphor for the significance of the hippie revolution. In the end, it all went up in a puff of smoke. The admiration of hedonism in our culture hasn't died, but it has taken upon a different form. Thankfully at least taking baths has come back in a big way. If I need a lift in knowing that there are people out there trying to change the world I'll look to the Nelson Mandelas and the Gandhis of the world. And this book will remain as forgotten as a memory of Woodstock.</td>\n",

Too few pictures. Some of the blocks are best explained using pictures, remember the old adage - a picture speaks ........2. Sometimes too critical of asian martial art systems. In all fairness though, Mr.Quinn himself does state pretty early on the benefits of his grounding in the eastern systems HOWEVER it is very easy to infer from his book that eastern systems dont work at all. Thats not true. Eastern systems prepare the mind as much as the body for \"effortless action\" and \"relentless attack\". the \"one mind\" concept is a spinnoff of the zen philosophy(in turn derived from the indian concept of \"shunya\" meaning Nill or \"nought\"). this philosophical background to eastern martial systems makes it look archaic and burdensome.

In this work of fiction, the author uses the main character to narrate and reveal the harsh realities of pledge life and college experiences in general.Ever since she was an infant and her mother dressed her in a Beta Gamma Psi sleepergown, Eva Perkins seemed destined to be a Beta. After all, both her mother and sister are Betas. So when Eva enrolls at Edwin Carver Science &amp; Technology University , it is no surprise that she is on a mission to pledge Beta. Unfortunately, she learns that freshmen cannot pledge so she has to wait a whole year. Meanwhile, she tries to prove herself on the school's swim team and maintain her grades since the Betas require a 2.8 GPA or above.Finally, her sophomore year comes and she's convinced that she'll be chosen to go on line, especially since she's worked at Beta community events, contributed money to buying one of the sorors a gift and even babysat a soror's child. Much to her dismay, she finds out that the Betas already have a line and she's not on it. Although most girls would be dissuaded, Eva's pursuit to one day wear the Beta colors of purple and teal does not end.Finally, patience pays off and Eva gets a phone call. Before she knows it, she is signing forms, paying fees and moving into the Beta house. Her dreams are finally coming true. She and five other pledge sisters are officially on line. In the name of sisterhood, the pledges are forced to bond. In one instance they are even handcuffed to one another. Although the tight bond between them is eventually developed, there are issues along the way. Ultimately, one pledge drops and wants revenge.After weeks of humiliation, emotional torture and essentially being slaves for the big sisters, the pledges are ready to \"cross over,\" the final step to becoming a soror. To celebrate the fact that they would soon be full-fledged Betas, the pledges engage in the ritual of spray painting the English building and the unthinkable happens. In the face of tragedy, Eva is faced with a huge dilemma that forces her to choose between being loyal and being honorable. How much will she give up to be a Beta?Be My Sorority Sister--Under Pressure is perfect for young adult readers, especially young ladies who are on their way to college and thinking about pledging a sorority.This novel is a fast read, but at times it is too fast. Characters such as Seneca, Arcadia and Kylie seemed superfluous without real development, making them forgettable. Although the story is engaging, it would have benefited from more descriptions of places, things and events. All in all, the author presents a good, solid story and lessons learnedReviewed by Joan Burke Stanford of Loose Leaves Book Review</td>\n",

       "      <td>This book is interesting and still timely for a number of reasons. Michael Lewis was not hired by Salomon Brothers by going through the usual channels. That is, he didn't just send in his CV and go through a series of interviews. He did have or was finishing his master's degree at LSE and that would ordinarily be considered very competitive. But the details are quite intriguing. There are also several pages dealing with John Meriwether of Long-Term Capital fame. Meriwether, of course, directed the largest financial collapse in history, and he was trained at Salomon as were many other of these infamous bond traders. Its evidently no longer true that &amp;quot;Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those (the banks) who lend the money&amp;quot; (see the article on Alan Greenspan in BusinessWeek, 12 Oct. 98)! Or has the FED always been in front of the eight ball? You would think that Frank Partnoy (FIASCO) would REALLY be upset with this idea rather than fuming about a zero-sum game in which there is always a winner and a loser with fairly normal contracts. I can't think of a worse case nuclear-waste derivative than 80:1 margin with long and short positions on every possible bond, CMO, and currency in the world all controlled by an arrogant hedge fund manager. This unheard of leverage could only be done by dozens of banks loaning out money on collateral that was already used to procure a loan across the street. Where was Frank when this was going on? Morgan Stanley was not even involved directly with LTCM, and perhaps that explains Frank's silence. Even to this day those at LTCM have a mantra that goes like &amp;quot;You know the model worked really well except for this tiny little problem&amp;quot;, and that phrase is usually followed by &amp;quot;You don't understand (we are just too smart for you), all that was wrong was a tiny bit of bad timing and not quite enough leverage&amp;quot;. Yes, a little tiny non convergence in interest rates did all that damage, and you boys and girls should be in jail. No retail broker would ever do anything like that. My answer to all this is that if you have spent 15 min studying the Black-Scholes equation and geometric Brownian motion of stock prices, you have wasted more than 14 min of your time. Lets hear from Frank. I think what I found most interesting in Liar's Poker was Mr. Lewis's detailed explanation of the development of the mortgage security market at Salomon Brothers. This info is not readily available, and I have no reason to doubt Mr. Lewis's account. If Salomon was the top investment bank when this book was written, times have certainly changed, because they are not even among the top three investment banks today.</td>\n",

I hadn't read it in years, and found it just as enthralling as it was over thirty years ago.But I was surprised at how difficult it was to ignore the presence of the Red Bull...I mean, the energy drink, which kept diluting the serious and mysterious fear due to Haggard's bull. I've come to terms with my last name, and the connotations recent acquaintances attach to me because of it, but I was sad that such a great piece of literature had been sullied by a cultural phenomenon.   \n",

I loved it. Henley has the ability to capture not only the time period, but also the culture of the borderlands between Scotland and England and the difficult but wonderful relationship between two stubborn, courageous people. I highly recommend this one.Set in Scotland in 1512, TEMPTED is the story of clans Douglas, Hamilton and Kennedy. Beautiful Valentina Kennedy, the oldest of the Kennedy daughters, was known as Flaming Tina for her glorious red-gold hair and her feisty temper. She was raised with her sister and brothers in Castle Doon in Ayr on the Southwest coast of Scotland where her father ruled as the Lord of Galloway. Tina despaired the lot of women that prevented them from enjoying male pursuits, and she frequently joined her brothers in their activities. But when she turns 17, her father insists she say yes to one of her many suitors. Tina thinks to marry the Hamilton heir but is happy when the Gypsy tells her there will be no wedding for her this year. In a surprising turn of events, she is hand fasted to her enemy, the powerful Black Ram Douglas, who she considers to be a brute of a man. Tina intends to have her revenge...Henley develops some wonderful characters, including the ghosts of two star-crossed lovers from the past (another Kennedy and Douglas pairing), who constantly entertain. She paints vivid word pictures of the food, clothing and castles that really drawn you in and help you experience the times--and she does it very well. In a fitting climax to the story, she superbly describes the battle between the English and Scots at Flodden where Scotland went down in terrible defeat.This is going on my Best Scottish/Highlander Historical Romances list! The second in the 2-book Clan Kennedy Saga is THE BORDER HOSTAGE.   \n",

The only interesting character is Lady Bret Ashley, and this is only because she is so pretensious and dull witted that it brought out a severe hatred in me.Good writing style but not much doing here otherwise. I wish this generation would stay lost, they're very, very boring.   \n",

She is aware of the situation that she is in but her passion for life and her faith in people displays her innocence and the fact that she is so young.I was fascinated by the way she obviously matured through the years that she was hiding and completely horrified by some of the topics that she was dealing with in her diary.A very good book.   \n",

Patrick Dearen has written an instant classic that deserves a place on anyone's list of Best Western Novels.\" -- D. R. Meredith, Roundup Magazine of Western Writers of America.\"Admirable . . . a powerful novel reminiscent of Edward Abbey's `The Brave Cowboy' . . . . Excellent.\" -- Dallas Morning News.\"The tale of . . . a cowboy born a century too late . . . . Bright and poignant . . . . A sharply drawn and memorable novel.\" -- Dale Walker, Rocky Mountain News.\"Departs intriguingly from classic western form . . . . A tale of a cowboy born 100 years too late and of his desperate run from the law.\" -- Publishers Weekly.\"A spellbinding tale of the modern world against the last cowboy.\" -- San Angelo Standard-Times.\"Pits one man's nineteenth century dreams against another man's twentieth century reality.\" -- Books of the Southwest.\"The last cowboy in our modern world decides to risk his life by stealing a horse and escaping to the Colorado Divide where he can live as cowboys did a hundred years ago . . . . Inspired by an actual horseback-helicopter manhunt in Texas . . . .

[Dearen's] skills . . . argue for the survival of America's most fascinating and probably only authentic myth.\" -- Texas Books in Review.\"A modern chase novel that pits cutting-edge technology against a lone cowboy. It sounds like a complete mismatch--and it is, though not in exactly the way one might think.\" -- recommended reading list, What Do I Read Next?, 1995 edition.\"The story of a modern-day cowboy who is determined to live or die by the cowboy code . . . . The reader can almost hear the serenades of the crickets, cicadas, and coyotes. You will want to read this book even if you don't normally read westerns.\" -- Austin American-Statesman.\"Patrick Dearen . . . is of the [Elmer] Kelton School . . . . The story gains color and character from [Dearen's] incredible 74 interviews with men who took up cowboying between 1899 and 1931.\" -- Kent Biffle, Dallas Morning-News.\"If you're a western fan and have only $20 to spend in the bookstore this year, spend it on `When Cowboys Die.' And when you close the book, step outside and look toward the west and whisper, `Keep on riding, Charlie--for all of us.'\" -- Amarillo Sunday Globe-News.   \n",

However one of the stories, the \"Lamia in the Cevernnes\" is really wonderful and creepy.The volume of short stories, \"The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye\" also had uneven quality but contained one of the finest novellas in the English lanuage, the piece from which the volume gets its name.I sometimes think of A.S. Byatt as the writter of adult fairy stories or folk tales. The story, Lamia in the Cevernnes, certainly fits this description. It is the story of a painter, escaping conservative England to the remote countryside of France. His swimming pool seems to have a spoiled odor and ichy color, so he drains it and fills it with river water. However he has unknowingly captured a river spirit. This spirit, the Lamia, gradually makes herself known to him. First she appears as an underwater shadow, then as a caress from an invisible force under the water, then as a more distinct ghosty image, and then finally she reveals herself to the artists. She is a giant colorful snake-like creature with the eyes and mouth and teeth of a human. She asks for a kiss and promises untold fortune. Byatt describes the gradual approach of the Lamia to the artist with such creepy skill that she made my skin crawl. We have all felt the underwater touch of an invisible hand. We have all seen a glimpse of some underwater spirit, now visible, now gone, that makes the hair stand up on your head. Byatt captures this sensation so very well with her amazing craft.Not as complex as her novels, but insightful well-crafted tales, her short story collections always contain at least one tale that hits me at the animal instinctual level.   \n",

I can truly say that &quot;He Knows Whereof He Speaks.&quot; This book will do your relationship as much good as &quot;Men are from Mars, Women From Venus,&quot; perhaps more, and will be a lot easier to read. In fact, because of its extreme readability (all blank pages) the men in your lives, Sisters, will be able to finish it during the first commercial of the Super Bowl! Read on!   \n",

This book was a departure. I think there were too many gizmo, wizbang, gee-whiz kind of toys in this novel. The characters never really had to stretch themselves to accomplish anything, because the technology did it all for them.The other thing I kept having trouble with was the character of Charlie. If he was a Marine Sniper in Vietnam and the book is set in about 2020, then Charlie would be pushing 70+ years. It just didn't hold together.However, if you walk away from the need for a realistic, techno thriller and look at the book as Sci Fi, well it isn't too bad. The gadgets are kind of kool when you look at it this way, although, the characters need some work.   \n",

Actually, Lewis Carroll was a very smart man. He invented Wonderland to show people truths in their own world most people wouldn't even bother thinking about. In fact, I think the whole point of the book is that even though Wonderland seems so unreal and full of nonsence, it's really just the same as our own world! I admit, I was curious about what a book so popular written for children would be like. It was great! I'd recomend it to anyone!   \n",
       "16  The slim pages of Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad contain a surprise: three books for the price of one! The only problem is that none of these books is particularly good.The first book lurking in Rich Dad, Poor Dad would have made a nice pamphlet, or about 20 powerpoint slides, describing the author's financial philosophy. Some Kiyosaki's sound bites are on target(Americans need more financial education; working for your self is empowering; it's a good idea to acquire assets that generate positive cash flow), some are provocative (a house should be considered a liability, not an asset), and some are downright loopy (\"pay yourself first\", even when you don't have enough to pay your bills, so that angry creditors make you work harder). Right or wrong, the basic ideas are all worth thinking about.But you can't charge much for a pamphlet, so this thin layer of material is padded out to fill a second book, which strains to reach 195 pages of random transitions and endless repetition. It's a bit like being stuck next to a talkative but slightly drunk businessman for six hours on a plane. You don't need to worry about missing anything, because you're going to hear it again.Just one example:\"In fact, if you really want to be confused, look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, but for the average person it makes no sense.\" (p. 59).\"If you want a lesson in confusion, simply look up the words 'asset' and 'liability' in the dictionary. Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average perion, it may as well be written in Mandarin.\" (p. 61).Yes, folks, that's a mere two pages apart. And it's hardly an aberration in this book. You have to wonder what co-author Sharon Lechter and the editor of this book did for their paychecks besides press \"play\" on the tape recorder.The third book contained in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is the most interesting--and most disturbing. It's hard to tell how seriously to take the backstory behind the author's financial genius--one suspects a lot of embellishment to serve the clever title. Still, there is an alarming genuineness to Kiyosaki's repeated trashings of his real father, whom he alternately refers to as his \"educated dad\" or \"poor dad\". This fellow seems to have enjoyed a successful career as a teacher, government official and union leader (and supposedly acquired enough assets to be subject to the estate tax--not bad for a \"poor\" dad). Nevertheless, his son views him as a pathetic failure compared to his \"rich dad\", the entrepreneur-speculator father of his best friend. This vaguely drawn figure (perhaps based on a real person) gives Kiyosaki some helpful advice at a young age, but there's nothing to elevate him to \"dad\" status--other than Kiyosaki's all-too-real loathing of his own father. Kiyosaki's own raging insecurities (centered on his lack of educational attainments and paternal disapproval of his career path) take center stage in this Oedipal drama. This part of the book gave me the creeps.   \n",

When I saw by accident that this book was on sale, I bought it. I thought it started slowly - just as life in English countryside in the 1930s must have been slow and unhurried. We meet the young veterinarian who also narrates the story when his practice just begins and with him we get to know \"all creatures great and small\" whom he meets, helps to get better when he can or helps to end their sufferings when he can't. I thought this book was full of love in the best way and very well written.   \n",

It'll be interesting to get my half-German daughter to read it. At any rate: teenagers, surplus rocket ship, Nazis, moon landing.

Jim Collins academic background is very apparent in his approach. It is refreshing to see a more rigorous approach, compared to many other books that are based on personal experience, intuition, and opinion. Highyl recommended.   \n",

A boy from Texas or so, comes to a different state. Why? Because of his dad's job. They always moved around. So this guy meets Beatrice because he always had to see another guy run barefoot super fast. Beatrice told him to stay away but he couldn't. He was just so amazed by his speed, and he didn't even go to school. So this boy couldn't stay away, well he didn't until he met him. His \"name\" was Butterfingers because he caught these small fish with his bare hands. He was hiding from his parents because he was \"bad,\" he was rebellious. Beatrice & Butterfingers were brother and sister, so she helped him hide. They were trying to avoid the construction of a new pancake house in the place where baby owls lived underground. The people from the pancake house (meaning the boss) knew about these owls, but he still wanted that place. Well, I've said enough. Find out how it ends by reading this book, because there is alot to learn from it. Well at least that's what I think, and I think that this book teaches people to stand up for the little guys. I recommend this book to people who care about the enviroment.   \n",

I have to say, I really enjoyed the first book \"Eye of the World\". The way the story developed and the characters was fascinating and I was sucked in. About halfway through this second book things.....began....to....slow...way....down. I don't know if I am just tired of following of the same story or if Jordan's writing pace is just wearing me down. I enjoy in depth character studies....but usually only when it pertains to characters who will be focused on throughout the story, Jordan seems to give even the bit players a lengthy description. Also, I am beginning to suspect that almost any storyline involving the main characters; Perrin, Mat, Rand, Loial etc..are beginning to lose the tension the first book held because I don't think Jordan will let any real harm come to them in these first few books. So, when Mat's life seems in danger midway through the book, I don't feel the urgent need to read on because I already know he will survive. I don't know how...just that Jordan doesn't seem willing to kill off one of his main characters. Also, I hope that Jordan will begin to populate his novels with average looking or ugly people. So far everyone who happens along is exceedingly beautiful or strikingly handsome. I was kind of hoping Rand would be described as looking like Clint Howard just to balance things off. Still this isn't a bad book, but I don't think it lives up to the promise of the \"Eye of the World\". The action and climax of this book is very good once you get there, but be warned, you don't want to start this series here, you would be completely lost.   \n",

Read it now so you too can see the beauty of what a little hard boiled egg and a slice of ham could mean to someone.It might taste differently to you after reading this classic memoir.   \n",
       "25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Reading these reviews for such a wonderful tale, I was struck by the profusion of slights to the tedious style employed by the author. Now, I thought this was a fact anyone reading the book would have known from prior knowledge, but I guess not: Gaston Leroux was not an Englishman! His story is not tediously, almost boringly written, the English translation from the original French is! When transferring a work of literature from one language to the other, it is necessary to make concessions to the cadence and stylistic idioms of the adopted language, thus necessitating a change in form and style, since a verbatim translation is a thing practically impossible to obtain, particularly when translating from a Romance language (like French) to a Germanic language (like English.) Consider this: would one expect Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, if translated into another language such as French or German, to retain the poetic gravity that it possesses in its native English? Works of literature are written to conform to the rules, and indeed beauty, of the writer's native tongue, and therefore only retain their true beauty in that language. The phrase \"lost in translation\" reserves more pertinence here than anywhere else! Oftentimes a difference in translator can make the diferentiation between a good work and a great one (for proof of this phenomenon, compare the Norman MacAffee translation of Hugo's Les Miserables to that of Wilbour)but since relatively few translations of Phantom exist, we shall have to read that with which we are provided and merely speculate (unless the reader is fluent or at least conversational in French) at the beauty these words possessed in their native tongue!As for the novel itself, I\"d highly recommend its reading, and that is not just because I am an avid aficionado of French literature but, as I am myself a writer, because I recognize worthy literature when i read it. It is indeed refreshing to see the story of the Phantom as it was originally intended, before being heavily romanticized by Weber, and then Schumacher. For a fairly true-to-the-novel film adaptation, I'd suggest the 1926 silent film starring Lon Chaney. Adieu!   \n",

I'm not a big fan of spy books but if I have to drudge my way through one, this one would be it. It's pretty fast passed and easy reading. It keeps you confussed engough that you want to keep on reading. What I didn't like was that it seemed to forced. The charaters, the side love plot, a lot of the feelings and emotions expressed through the book, just didn't seem like they had to be there. It seemed like LeCarre just thought &quot;it's a spy book, so I HAVE TO have this in it...&quot;. It would have been better if LeCarre had completely broken away from the stereotypical spy book as it seemed he was trying so hard to do.   \n",

It was difficult to keep track of all of the characters. The 468 pages were devoted mostly to lengthy descriptions about each characters clothes or body features.As a relatively recent reader of this genre, I found the whole Sidhe/Fey/Faere/Goblin/Brownie culture difficult to understand. Hamilton didn't provide enough information to help me separate each unique culture and then see their inter-relationships.I hope that Hamilton rescues my waivering trust and salvages the storyline in A Caress of Twilight.   \n",

As a survivor of domestic violence and child abuse, for over 20 years, I can certainly relate to the book. I have also been working in the field for quite a few years. I hope Dr. Dutton will be lecturing nearby, because I would love to meet him in person and hear more about updates in his research. Not enough is being done to understand batterers or to figure out the best way to work with them. Instead of people complaining about his book or any other (on batterers), they should appreciate the fact someone has given a darn about this issue. After all, what are you doing? You can find my thesis in my book Absent Hearts, Missing Pieces which is available through Amazon as well. You might find the final chapter a bit controversial though!   \n",

It is a beautifully crafted story, well-written and full of poignant moments. The richness of the plot had me hooked from early on, and surprisingly, it just kept getting better with each page. I hated to put it down! The nuances of the relationships in the book were fascinating and made the characters truly alive for me, often giving me a lot to think about even when I wasn't reading. This is a book I will encourage all my friends to borrow!   \n",

By this late in the alphabet, Milhone feels like an old friend who is dogged in her determination, uniquely clever and inventive, and has a somewhat sardonic sense of humor. I enjoy Grafton's mysteries as purely pleasurable reading; nothing better than kicking back on a rainy day or when I don't feel well and indulging in one of Grafton's stories. Albeit, I do alot of far more intellectual reading, but every now and then catching up with \"my old friend\" Kinsey Milhone is a real treat. Can't imagine why anyone wouldn't enjoy \"S is for Silence.\" Indulge and enjoy. . .   \n",

You do not need a degree in microbiology to understand this book. The information is so gripping I read the book in a day, I just could not put it down. I am a college student in microbiology and was amazed at how much information was provided regarding the history of infectious disease and the scientists that have help in the war against them - only to find out that the same microorganisms are rearing their ugly heads - again????? Strep throat has never been a problem in my lifetime but it looks like it will be in the near future. If you ejoyed the Coming Plague this is the book for you   \n",

Robert Boston's engaging book, largely accounts of his personal experiences, and informed by his vast knowledge, is an excellent place for students and others seeking introductory material to start. From there, such logical companion works as Frederick Clarkson's Eternal Hostility: The Stuggle Between Theocracy and Democracy; Jean Hardisty's Mobilizing Resentment, or Boston's other books, make much more sense. Close Encounters is a good beginning for a bookshelf about the religious right in the U.S.   \n",

When my daughter was very young I was afraid she was the only child born who never had a conscience. The psychologist at my local bookstore recommended the book to me. That is when I learned she was just very strong willed. His balance of methods, including swatting my child, were very helpful She is a grown adult now in full time Christian work.....I guess she DID have a conscience after all. I am very thankful for Dr. Dobson's wisdom and expertise in the area of children.   \n",

This is the &quot;classic western novel&quot; that everyone has been raving about? &quot;Shane&quot; lacks the elements of a good story almost completely. There is frighteningly little character development, and I find it a little strange that the reader knows next to nothing about the title character. Since other reviwers have already mentioned that pretty much nothing happens in this book, I will focus on the lack of information about Shane. The only concrete fact about Shane is that he has a mysterious past. Anything else that might be said about him is inferred,(as are most traits attributed to members of the Starrett family). Also, I believe that Schaefer pushed the whole &quot;Shane's past haunts him&quot; thing a little too far. The reader is constantly reminded of how &quot;poor Shane had something bad happen to him&quot;. This started to get old about 30 pgs in, and to add insult to injury, we are never told exactly what this &quot;bad thing&quot; was. Within literature it is sometimes for the best to leave things ambiguous, but usually, the piece of information that is never going to be told to the reader is not hinted at and/or alluded to every other page. It seemed to me that Shane's past was a vital part... scratch that, one of the only parts of his overall character. Ultimately, reading this book felt like watching the sequal to a movie I'd never seen, mostly because of the huge gaps in information about the characters. Without interesting characters, even a story with excellent prose and plot can fall flat. Shane, which had neither of these to begin with, was utterly dissapointing.   \n",
       "37                              What can be told about Tom Wolfe's Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test? It's a reporting of the Merry Pranksters and their whacked-out, drug addled misadventures across the country with Ken Kesey as their assumed and humble leader. While overall, I was not a big fan of this book, I should not continue without saying that there are some truly entertaining stories to be told here (Kesey's first experience with acid and the \"buddha\", Kesey meeting Owsley, experiences with the Dead, etc.). In fact, I wouldn't even necessarily not recommend it. I say this because I don't think the problems that I have with this book would bother the average reader.Having said this, I think that I just see this book as being moot. It's a story told about acidheads, from a person who never actually tried any acid. Anyone who has tried this psychedelic drug will try to explain it's significance to you, but will ultimately admit that it transcends words and it must simply be experienced (unintentional nod to Hendrix). Now, this could potentially not matter (and who would want to read the ramblings of a tripper anyhow?), but a sort of US V THEM scenario is created as a result. The \"us\" being Wolfe and the reader, and the \"them\" being the subjects of the book. The author, therefore the reader, seemingly stick out like a sore thumb in a style of book in which the reader is supposed to feel immersed in the time and place. If you want to hear an account of a Phish concert, do you want to hear it from the parents who have brought their 16 year old son to his first concert whilst sitting in the back row covering their mouths with handkerchiefs as to avoid inhaling any marijuana smoke, or do you want to hear from the guy near the front who has created an open space for himself from the reeling of fellow concert goers as to avoid the flailing limbs of his frantic dance? I know my answer.However, the fatal flaw for me, which may not bother anyone else is that the appeal of the subject matter seemed to diminish as time went on. The book maintained a level of interest in me that was equal the number of pages I held in my right hand. I went from the wide-eyed curiosity of the examination of a group of people determined to change the world, to being bored and kind of angry that a group of drug-addled hedonists had garnered so much attention. They contributed nothing to society, other than proving that simply TALKING ABOUT changing the world won't amount to anything if you simply lie around and trip out and screw each other all day. My interest in this book was a perfect metaphor for the significance of the hippie revolution. In the end, it all went up in a puff of smoke. The admiration of hedonism in our culture hasn't died, but it has taken upon a different form. Thankfully at least taking baths has come back in a big way. If I need a lift in knowing that there are people out there trying to change the world I'll look to the Nelson Mandelas and the Gandhis of the world. And this book will remain as forgotten as a memory of Woodstock.   \n",

Most of the W.I.T.C.H. books are good...and the drawings look fine! Cornelia can be sad if she wants to! It's her boyfriend! Well, like, what if you're boyfriend was a flower? How would you feel? BUT, there's a catch to that, you shouldn't be staying out of school for that long just because of that! Anyways, this was a little better.   \n",

Ed Hoornaert has done this with The Trial of Tompa Lee and furthermore made such a delightful rendering of language through the Navy's translator that I often just stopped to re-read the dialogue. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it for anyone who wants a well-thought-out coming of self story written with a quiet sense of humor.   \n",

There are enough other things going on that you don't get bored, and wonder what is going to happen next. I would highly recommend this one.   \n",

Quinn speaks from experience and training. His anecdotes on his real life experience dealing with nut jobs serve as a reality check for every hot blooded teenager itching to get into a fight at the street corner. the techniques are well grounded and sure to work in the hands of a reasonably skilled and alert person.There are 2 reasons for giving this 4 stars in place of 51. Too few pictures. Some of the blocks are best explained using pictures, remember the old adage - a picture speaks ........2. Sometimes too critical of asian martial art systems. In all fairness though, Mr.Quinn himself does state pretty early on the benefits of his grounding in the eastern systems HOWEVER it is very easy to infer from his book that eastern systems dont work at all. Thats not true. Eastern systems prepare the mind as much as the body for \"effortless action\" and \"relentless attack\". the \"one mind\" concept is a spinnoff of the zen philosophy(in turn derived from the indian concept of \"shunya\" meaning Nill or \"nought\"). this philosophical background to eastern martial systems makes it look archaic and burdensome. However, its worth learning and thereby respecting.Overall, a great book and a sure guide to survival for the average joe on the street.   \n",

In this work of fiction, the author uses the main character to narrate and reveal the harsh realities of pledge life and college experiences in general.Ever since she was an infant and her mother dressed her in a Beta Gamma Psi sleepergown, Eva Perkins seemed destined to be a Beta. After all, both her mother and sister are Betas. So when Eva enrolls at Edwin Carver Science & Technology University , it is no surprise that she is on a mission to pledge Beta. Unfortunately, she learns that freshmen cannot pledge so she has to wait a whole year. Meanwhile, she tries to prove herself on the school's swim team and maintain her grades since the Betas require a 2.8 GPA or above.Finally, her sophomore year comes and she's convinced that she'll be chosen to go on line, especially since she's worked at Beta community events, contributed money to buying one of the sorors a gift and even babysat a soror's child. Much to her dismay, she finds out that the Betas already have a line and she's not on it. Although most girls would be dissuaded, Eva's pursuit to one day wear the Beta colors of purple and teal does not end.Finally, patience pays off and Eva gets a phone call. Before she knows it, she is signing forms, paying fees and moving into the Beta house. Her dreams are finally coming true. She and five other pledge sisters are officially on line. In the name of sisterhood, the pledges are forced to bond. In one instance they are even handcuffed to one another. Although the tight bond between them is eventually developed, there are issues along the way. Ultimately, one pledge drops and wants revenge.After weeks of humiliation, emotional torture and essentially being slaves for the big sisters, the pledges are ready to \"cross over,\" the final step to becoming a soror. To celebrate the fact that they would soon be full-fledged Betas, the pledges engage in the ritual of spray painting the English building and the unthinkable happens. In the face of tragedy, Eva is faced with a huge dilemma that forces her to choose between being loyal and being honorable. How much will she give up to be a Beta?Be My Sorority Sister--Under Pressure is perfect for young adult readers, especially young ladies who are on their way to college and thinking about pledging a sorority.This novel is a fast read, but at times it is too fast. Characters such as Seneca, Arcadia and Kylie seemed superfluous without real development, making them forgettable. Although the story is engaging, it would have benefited from more descriptions of places, things and events. All in all, the author presents a good, solid story and lessons learnedReviewed by Joan Burke Stanford of Loose Leaves Book Review   \n",

Michael Lewis was not hired by Salomon Brothers by going through the usual channels. That is, he didn't just send in his CV and go through a series of interviews. He did have or was finishing his master's degree at LSE and that would ordinarily be considered very competitive. But the details are quite intriguing. There are also several pages dealing with John Meriwether of Long-Term Capital fame. Meriwether, of course, directed the largest financial collapse in history, and he was trained at Salomon as were many other of these infamous bond traders. Its evidently no longer true that &quot;Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those (the banks) who lend the money&quot; (see the article on Alan Greenspan in BusinessWeek, 12 Oct. 98)! Or has the FED always been in front of the eight ball? You would think that Frank Partnoy (FIASCO) would REALLY be upset with this idea rather than fuming about a zero-sum game in which there is always a winner and a loser with fairly normal contracts. I can't think of a worse case nuclear-waste derivative than 80:1 margin with long and short positions on every possible bond, CMO, and currency in the world all controlled by an arrogant hedge fund manager. This unheard of leverage could only be done by dozens of banks loaning out money on collateral that was already used to procure a loan across the street. Where was Frank when this was going on? Morgan Stanley was not even involved directly with LTCM, and perhaps that explains Frank's silence. Even to this day those at LTCM have a mantra that goes like &quot;You know the model worked really well except for this tiny little problem&quot;, and that phrase is usually followed by &quot;You don't understand (we are just too smart for you), all that was wrong was a tiny bit of bad timing and not quite enough leverage&quot;. Yes, a little tiny non convergence in interest rates did all that damage, and you boys and girls should be in jail. No retail broker would ever do anything like that. My answer to all this is that if you have spent 15 min studying the Black-Scholes equation and geometric Brownian motion of stock prices, you have wasted more than 14 min of your time. Lets hear from Frank. I think what I found most interesting in Liar's Poker was Mr. Lewis's detailed explanation of the development of the mortgage security market at Salomon Brothers. This info is not readily available, and I have no reason to doubt Mr. Lewis's account. If Salomon was the top investment bank when this book was written, times have certainly changed, because they are not even among the top three investment banks today.   \n",

Karen writes in such a way that &amp;quot;bam&amp;quot; she grabs your attention in the very beginning and pulls you right into the story itself. While reading this novel, I felt a real familiarity with the two main characters, Grimm and Jillian. She really gets into setting up the background (but doesn't pound it - background info, that is - to death like so many other authors do, so much that you want to put the book down right then) for her characters so that you feel like you know them personally. You can really &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the characters' emotions and the conflicts going on between them. I have to say that it's so very easy with Karen Moning's writing style to get totally caught up and lost in the story line. When I read her first book &amp;quot;Beyond the Highland Mist&amp;quot;, I didn't think that a romance novel could get any better. Boy was I wrong. This novel, in my opinion, far surpasses the last, which like I said above, didn't think could get any better!

       "      <td>ShaderX2 is broken in to two volumes, with this volume intended as an introduction to shader related topics to prepare the reader for the other volume, or for other shader books. It fills that role fairly well, though it does have a few shortcomings that keep it from being a great book.The book starts off with an extensive, well-written introduction to HLSL that most beginners to the language will find quite helpful. This is followed by a handy introduction to Shader Model 3.0, which explains the changes that have been made since 2.0, and the practical applications of these changes and additions.The next several chapters are devoted to implementing \"foundational\" techniques using shaders. The first covers several lighting and shading techniques, providing sample shader implementations in HLSL and assembly. Most of the shaders come in multiple versions for the various shader models, which is useful for supporting these techniques on a wide range of platforms, as well as in understanding the capability differences between each model.The next chapter covers five different fog effects using HLSL shaders. Then there are two chapters on shadows, one on shadow mapping and the other on shadow volumes. The latter weighs in at over 80 pages, providing in-depth coverage of the theory behind the technique.Next up is a tutorial for using the shader development environment RenderMonkey. The usefulness of this chapter is marred by the fact that the current version of RenderMonkey has undergone some interface changes such that the text is now out of synch with the tool, making it a bit more difficult to follow along. Still, if you can work through this, the chapter will help you quickly get up and running with RenderMonkey.The last chapter of the book is about creating shader-friendly models. This chapter seems out of place since it's written more for artists than programmers (who are clearly the audience for the rest of the book), and the chapter is too brief and vague to be of much value.If you're new to shaders and HLSL, you'll likely find this book useful, though it's a little expensive for a small book (I imagine the color plates contribute to this). If the shadow and fog chapters had been moved to the other ShaderX2 book, and the final chapter had been dropped, I think that they could have reduced the price considerably and made the book more focused, turning it into a great value. As it is, though, it's still a good book that many people will benefit from.</td>\n",

This is the story of Raskolnikov, a destitute young student who decides to kill an old woman pawnbroker. The world would be better off without this old cheat, Raskolnikov decides in his self-appointed position as judge, jury and executioner. Of course, things don't go according to plan, and Raskolnikov ends up killing another person as well. The story then proceeds to Raskolnikov's conscience, the investigation, and the entry of other people into his life - including Sonya, a young woman forced into prostitution by economic necessity. Readers get a feel for city life in Czarist Russia circa 1866, plus its dire poverty and other problems.Russian literature can be difficult for English speakers, but this book is probably one of the easier works by Dostoyevsky (or other Russian novelist).

The cuisine is all the more interesting for that fact. There are distinctly Austrian influences throughout the cuisine, including a recipe for an obscure Hungarian sweet crepe, palacinka, my Grandmother from Austria-Hungary would often make. The most vivid picture I get from the book is how food must have acquired the importance it has for many Europeans, since they spent so much of their time acquiring food and working with such inventive ways of making everything edible into something delicious.The chapters on game cookery are expecially useful, including recipes for quail, Guinea hen, pheasant, squab, duck (with sauerkraut, of course), rabbit, venison, and wild boar. Of special interest is the technique, `Squazet' which is an untranslatable word meaning a braising method used in Istria, suitable primarily to slow cooked meats. A good example of making the most of what you had.All the recipes are good as well as interesting for being examples of Istrian cuisine. However, I would recommend that for breads and pasteries, one consult a specialist in these fields. These baking recipes will work, but I know there are better techniques to be had. The sections on fresh pasta are short, but they appear to give competant results. The sections on various types of gnocchi and it's techniques are very good. I believe the recipes for mushrooms have much to offer which you may not find elsewhere.The treatment of photographs in this book leaves something to be desired. All are presented in an old fashioned sepia tint and some, even some photographed specifically for the book by modern equipment seem to loose detail to shadows and haziness. Placing captions for chapter heading photographs strikes at the rear of the book in an appendix strikes me as a case of really poor judgement. I have a hunch the captions were forgotten until it was too late to include them on the same page as the photo. There are some lapses in copy editing. The Italian culinary term `sugo' is used in the memoir and no explanation is given for the term. It does not even appear in the appendix and is arcane enough to be absent from Larousse Gastronomique and a reference on Italian cuisine. I would have been baffled by the reference had I not encountered in the book `Cooking by Hand' by Paul Bertolli.I give this book the highest rating because it's shortcomings do not detract from it's primary mission of being an engaging and accessible presentation of Istrian cuisine.</td>\n",

I'm a 19 year old college student now, and I still pick it up! One of the beauties of this book is how it applies to all ages. Children giggle as they understand the jokes withing the fantasy and the morals of the story. Adults laugh at the social commentary and the jokes that kids may not yet understand. Even after reading this book for so long, I can still read it and notice things I never picked up on before. (It took many years of reading before I picked up on the &amp;quot;Has Beens&amp;quot; comment.) :-) Kids, contrary to what adults may think, can understand many, if not most, of the lessons presented. In a fantasy setting, they see what can &amp;quot;happen&amp;quot; if one over-eats, is spoiled, chews too much gum, or watches too much T.V.--basically, if one is too indulgent. And they see that wealth does not necessarily buy happiness. Obviously, these characters will not be seen everyday in &amp;quot;real life,&amp;quot; but that's not the point. They represent different aspects of our society, and in no way does it suggest that all children are like this. It just gives humorous examples of what over-indulgence can do to a person. And if anyone is like me, they get a certain gratification in knowing that the rotten children in this book got what they deserved. ;-)</td>\n",

Ms. Valdez chose not to rest on her laurels, so to speak, and wrote an erotic romance with a little more edge than Passion. However, the elements which made Passion wonderful are also here.All in all, I highly recommend this book. It is highly explicit, very erotic, and NOT for the feint-hearted. On the other hand, the other reviewer's focus on the spankings and the BDSM (which is very light, actually) is a discredit to this book and the writer. I would caution readers who do not enjoy eroticism and find trouble with the more explicit writers to, please, not read such books and then make negative comments. For us who specifically look to such writers, our ratings are based on the content of the story, not on whether the heroine cried though a spanking. (By the way, I cannot believe how many readers missed the point of that scene...\"she was beaten!!!\" \"she was crying!!!\"...um, she was quite explicitly NOT crying due to pain...draw your own conclusions.)</td>\n",

Try instead whips, chains, cages, humiliation, degradation, brutality, and rape. Nevertheless, as hard as he tries,... Clitus Vitellius is unable to suppress his tender feelings, so unbecoming to a Master of the Warrior Caste, toward pretty little Judy. This is the second of the Gor novels to be told from the perspective of an abducted Earth girl enslaved on Gor. Judy aka Dina aka Yata is nowhere near the nasty piece of work that Elinor Brinton of Captive of Gor was. Also, she accepts her slavery much more readily than EB so you would think that her experiences on Gor would not be as harsh. Wrong! This book differs from Captive in several other ways. For one thing it actually has a plot. Unbeknownst to Judy she carries an implanted message to a Cosian agent of the Kurii that has bearing on the interplanetary struggle for control of both Gor and Earth. Of course, after an initial taste of this plot it stops for the next 300 pages or so in order to give the reader a look at what life is like for a slave girl on Gor. If your interest is Gorean lifestyle, you'll like this part. Otherwise, it can be slow going. Another difference from Captive is that there is a fair amount of action especially in the last 150 pages when Tarl Cabot again shows up as Bosk of Port Kar. (Rask of Treve briefly shows up again as well.) The revelation of Judy's hidden message sets up the next novel; however, there is nothing here that seems crucial to understanding subsequent volumes in the series. This is clearly a better novel than Captives but not as good as the action-oriented books.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Austen's novels are characterized by their limited plot and their freedom from deep philosophical musings, complicated image patterns and symbolism. As a result the reader is presented with a skilfully crafted novel in which setting, character delineation, acute observation of social interaction, accuracy and realism are all very important. The early novels were characterized by the use of irony, humour and satire. These are much less evident in Persuasion, as Austen seemed more concerned with the sympathetic and sensitive expoloration of her heroine's character and situation. Persuasion is a simply structured novel, for its plot is concerned only with bringing Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth together. A major theme of the novel is Austen's examination of pride and vanity - pride in one's social position and vanity of one's personal appearance. The idea of persuadability is tied up with another major concern of the novel - the right quality of mind. As the novel develops, Austen strives to achieve a right balance between contrasting opposites. I started to read the book reluctantly (as it was for school); but when I was familiar with the characters and the language, it was very enjoyable. If you have ever been in love, or thought yourself to be, or even had a crush on someone; you will identify with Anne Elliot's behaviour when she is around Captain Wentworth. It was amazing how real the characters came to be, and the events which occured can be compared of those today. I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in love stories. It was the first Austen book I have read, and it will not be the last.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This first book of Jane Austen's doesn't have the same subtlety as her later works, but it is light-hearted and good writing. It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age. I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the characters are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader. It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged). The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period. Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book. Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious.</td>\n",

He meets the heroine and she is caring for her elderly grandfather, and the weak willed nephew who will inherit his property is again in trouble and hovers like a vulture creating a part of the mystery.So,Captain Staple becomes more drawn into the problem, he meets a goodhearted highwayman who has been kind to the boy and Captain Staple unravels the mysteries; where is the boy's father, why are the shady relatives of the heroine hanging around waiting for her grandfather to die, and what happened to cause a Bow Street Runner to show up in the area. Great plot, interesting characters, and a very comfortable read.</td>\n",

I like to cook and when I have a chance to pore over the cookbooks and make something really special, I do it. But in the general course of life, I needed somone to point to the things she points to in this book. First, everyone should learn to cook with what they have, not the other way around. Too many people shop for the ingredients to match the recipe rather than what looks good. Second, too many people rely on 'prepared foods'(frozen dinners, etc.) every night of the week because they are busy - but how hard is it to fire up a pan and saute some chicken? Once you get that far, a pan sauce is pretty easy work (and she has a lot of great ideas in that area). Finally, this is good food. No, you will not see a recipe for rabbit livers simmered in cognac, but is that what you really want to make and eat every day? If so, go elsewhere. If you want a book to give you confidence and direction in becoming a good home cook (and I mean better than most people remember their moms to be) then buy this book. If you think you will not have any 'gourmet' flair with a simple book like this, I believe you may be surprised. I was talking to someone about a recipe I was making one time, and they commented that 'when you start talking about sauces, you start talking about gourmet food.' That is certainly a wild overstatement, but the confidence you will build with saucing your entrees will certainly raise the bar above what most people are eating in their houses these days.</td>\n",

It was a book that I truly could not put down. Karen writes in such a way that &quot;bam&quot; she grabs your attention in the very beginning and pulls you right into the story itself. While reading this novel, I felt a real familiarity with the two main characters, Grimm and Jillian. She really gets into setting up the background (but doesn't pound it - background info, that is - to death like so many other authors do, so much that you want to put the book down right then) for her characters so that you feel like you know them personally. You can really &quot;feel&quot; the characters' emotions and the conflicts going on between them. I have to say that it's so very easy with Karen Moning's writing style to get totally caught up and lost in the story line. When I read her first book &quot;Beyond the Highland Mist&quot;, I didn't think that a romance novel could get any better. Boy was I wrong. This novel, in my opinion, far surpasses the last, which like I said above, didn't think could get any better! I really loved everything about her latest novel - especially the way she grabs your attention from the start and keeps it the whole way through! Can't wait to read her next one!   \n",

I have since re-read it a number of times, and each time it reveals more of the nuance of character inherent to the individual hill-williams Mr. Harrington profiles in this classic novel. Having lived in Arkansas since the age of 11 I felt as if I'd grown up with many of the characters he portrays. If you enjoy ludicrous situations and quirky characters read this book NOW! It should be listed on the Norman Cousins health plan...   \n",

Doig puts words together in such a mannerthat they make complete, correct English sentences. Thisalone makes the book unusual in modern-day fiction. Then,he grabs your attention with a spellbinding story that hasall of the elements that make you want to begin reading andnever stop. His beloved Montana comes to life such thatyou can hear the constant wind, feel the biting cold, tastethe dust of the dry years, smell the sheep pens at shearingtime, and see the vast expanses of prarie fading into theimpossibly rugged mountains.This book grabbed me by the throat and wouldn't let go.Even long after my last reading of it, I am still moved bythe passion and power of the story. It is certainly amongthe best fiction I have read.   \n",

The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition.   \n",

Although it is interesting and I couldn't put it down, I found that its standing as a perennial anti-war book is undeserved. Sledge, in With the Old Breed, had a more profound impact on my understanding of the destruction, horror, and sense of helplessness and despair in war.   \n",

Gatsby's obsession, and the way the book provides a bit of action, love story, and manages to transport the reader to another era with so little effort, makes this title more than worthwhile. The last sentence is considered to be one of the great lines of literature, and the journey to that final page was enjoyable, every step of the way. It certainly had me pondering the price and value of love in the context of early modern American culture.   \n",

It fills that role fairly well, though it does have a few shortcomings that keep it from being a great book.The book starts off with an extensive, well-written introduction to HLSL that most beginners to the language will find quite helpful. This is followed by a handy introduction to Shader Model 3.0, which explains the changes that have been made since 2.0, and the practical applications of these changes and additions.The next several chapters are devoted to implementing \"foundational\" techniques using shaders. The first covers several lighting and shading techniques, providing sample shader implementations in HLSL and assembly. Most of the shaders come in multiple versions for the various shader models, which is useful for supporting these techniques on a wide range of platforms, as well as in understanding the capability differences between each model.The next chapter covers five different fog effects using HLSL shaders. Then there are two chapters on shadows, one on shadow mapping and the other on shadow volumes. The latter weighs in at over 80 pages, providing in-depth coverage of the theory behind the technique.Next up is a tutorial for using the shader development environment RenderMonkey. The usefulness of this chapter is marred by the fact that the current version of RenderMonkey has undergone some interface changes such that the text is now out of synch with the tool, making it a bit more difficult to follow along. Still, if you can work through this, the chapter will help you quickly get up and running with RenderMonkey.The last chapter of the book is about creating shader-friendly models. This chapter seems out of place since it's written more for artists than programmers (who are clearly the audience for the rest of the book), and the chapter is too brief and vague to be of much value.If you're new to shaders and HLSL, you'll likely find this book useful, though it's a little expensive for a small book (I imagine the color plates contribute to this). If the shadow and fog chapters had been moved to the other ShaderX2 book, and the final chapter had been dropped, I think that they could have reduced the price considerably and made the book more focused, turning it into a great value. As it is, though, it's still a good book that many people will benefit from.   \n",

Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was a master at character development and getting inside the souls of those he wrote about. This is the story of Raskolnikov, a destitute young student who decides to kill an old woman pawnbroker. The world would be better off without this old cheat, Raskolnikov decides in his self-appointed position as judge, jury and executioner. Of course, things don't go according to plan, and Raskolnikov ends up killing another person as well. The story then proceeds to Raskolnikov's conscience, the investigation, and the entry of other people into his life - including Sonya, a young woman forced into prostitution by economic necessity. Readers get a feel for city life in Czarist Russia circa 1866, plus its dire poverty and other problems.Russian literature can be difficult for English speakers, but this book is probably one of the easier works by Dostoyevsky (or other Russian novelist). This powerful tale of sin and redemption is well worth reading.   \n",

The recipes run from \"Mock Turtle\" soup (made with a calf's head) to \"Green Tomato Soy\" sauce. But what you probably are looking for is seafood recipes. Of course there are crabcake recipes as well as baked rock fish and fried oysters. But do you have a recipe for \"Oyster Pye\"? If not, this is the place to get the recipe.Just so you don't think all Marylanders eat is seafood, there is also many recipes for meat as well as poultry. There are also some awesome dessert recipes, such as strawberry rhubarb pie as well as lemon cookies.If you've missed the taste of Maryland cooking, or maybe you just want to find out about this regional cusine, you should by the book.   \n",

This book is great for all ages, but particularly good for teaching young children about nature. The Sams books are spectacular nature photography. I love reading them even without a child by my side.   \n",

But now, as an adult it is virtually impossible to escape it. Whether it means holding an intelligent conversation or stepping into the voting booth I've realized that it is so important to understand how our system works in order to understand the information thrown at us and make informed decisions.This book really helped me get there. Now, when I watch CNN I actually understand what I'm hearing. I'm also more comfortable with my political affiliation. A friend of mine is very informed on the subject and I have always admired his level of intelligence. Part of my reason for buying this book was to increase my ability to have an informed and unbiased discussion on today's most important topics.I would recommend this book to any high-school student studying American government or any adult feeling they want to understand our system better. The amount of information in the book is huge!! Don't try to memorize anything but the fundamentals. Other than that, either read through it, retain what you can, and keep it around as reference.   \n",

Once I started this book I did not want it to end. I wish there was a real wizard world.I read all 3 books. I can not wait till the next one comes.This is the best seires in a long time. They should make this a classic.   \n",
       "13  This first book by Lidia Bastianich is both cookbook of recipes from the Istrian peninsula and Felidia Ristorante in Manhatten and a memoir of Lidia's life and family in central Europe and in the United States. The recipes occupy by far the larger portion of the book and include all of the expected elements of Italian cuisine. The culinary chapters are:Appetizers and SoupsSalads and VegetablesPastas and SaucesFishMeatsGameBreads and DessertsSpirits and InfusionsThe most valuable portions of the book deal with the recipes native to Istria, especially those dealing with game and foraged vegetables and mushrooms. As the book makes clear, Istria, located near the top of the Adriatic Sea, is very near the crossroads of Europe's Roman, Slavic, and Germanic ethnic influences. The cuisine is all the more interesting for that fact. There are distinctly Austrian influences throughout the cuisine, including a recipe for an obscure Hungarian sweet crepe, palacinka, my Grandmother from Austria-Hungary would often make. The most vivid picture I get from the book is how food must have acquired the importance it has for many Europeans, since they spent so much of their time acquiring food and working with such inventive ways of making everything edible into something delicious.The chapters on game cookery are expecially useful, including recipes for quail, Guinea hen, pheasant, squab, duck (with sauerkraut, of course), rabbit, venison, and wild boar. Of special interest is the technique, `Squazet' which is an untranslatable word meaning a braising method used in Istria, suitable primarily to slow cooked meats. A good example of making the most of what you had.All the recipes are good as well as interesting for being examples of Istrian cuisine. However, I would recommend that for breads and pasteries, one consult a specialist in these fields. These baking recipes will work, but I know there are better techniques to be had. The sections on fresh pasta are short, but they appear to give competant results. The sections on various types of gnocchi and it's techniques are very good. I believe the recipes for mushrooms have much to offer which you may not find elsewhere.The treatment of photographs in this book leaves something to be desired. All are presented in an old fashioned sepia tint and some, even some photographed specifically for the book by modern equipment seem to loose detail to shadows and haziness. Placing captions for chapter heading photographs strikes at the rear of the book in an appendix strikes me as a case of really poor judgement. I have a hunch the captions were forgotten until it was too late to include them on the same page as the photo. There are some lapses in copy editing. The Italian culinary term `sugo' is used in the memoir and no explanation is given for the term. It does not even appear in the appendix and is arcane enough to be absent from Larousse Gastronomique and a reference on Italian cuisine. I would have been baffled by the reference had I not encountered in the book `Cooking by Hand' by Paul Bertolli.I give this book the highest rating because it's shortcomings do not detract from it's primary mission of being an engaging and accessible presentation of Istrian cuisine.   \n",

But love came make you do strange things! Kyle and Kimara are a fun couple to read about. I enjoy the reading a lot! If I was in Kimara shoes, I would not have thought twice about living out my dreams with my first crush! I highly recommend everyone who sees this book advertised to buy it, along with all of the other Brenda Jackson stories like the complete set of the Madaris Brothers stories, you will not regret it! Not to focus on this one author, the other two stories were very good also!   \n",

It takes and extremely positive approach about the art and about life; it stresses it's basic discipline principles and how to act positively. I highly recommend this old, but not forgotten resource to the young practitioner.   \n",

My parents used to read it to me, and as soon as I could, I read it to myself over and over. I'm a 19 year old college student now, and I still pick it up! One of the beauties of this book is how it applies to all ages. Children giggle as they understand the jokes withing the fantasy and the morals of the story. Adults laugh at the social commentary and the jokes that kids may not yet understand. Even after reading this book for so long, I can still read it and notice things I never picked up on before. (It took many years of reading before I picked up on the &quot;Has Beens&quot; comment.) :-) Kids, contrary to what adults may think, can understand many, if not most, of the lessons presented. In a fantasy setting, they see what can &quot;happen&quot; if one over-eats, is spoiled, chews too much gum, or watches too much T.V.--basically, if one is too indulgent. And they see that wealth does not necessarily buy happiness. Obviously, these characters will not be seen everyday in &quot;real life,&quot; but that's not the point. They represent different aspects of our society, and in no way does it suggest that all children are like this. It just gives humorous examples of what over-indulgence can do to a person. And if anyone is like me, they get a certain gratification in knowing that the rotten children in this book got what they deserved. ;-)   \n",

Ms. Valdez chose not to rest on her laurels, so to speak, and wrote an erotic romance with a little more edge than Passion. However, the elements which made Passion wonderful are also here.All in all, I highly recommend this book. It is highly explicit, very erotic, and NOT for the feint-hearted. On the other hand, the other reviewer's focus on the spankings and the BDSM (which is very light, actually) is a discredit to this book and the writer. I would caution readers who do not enjoy eroticism and find trouble with the more explicit writers to, please, not read such books and then make negative comments. For us who specifically look to such writers, our ratings are based on the content of the story, not on whether the heroine cried though a spanking. (By the way, I cannot believe how many readers missed the point of that scene...\"she was beaten!!!\" \"she was crying!!!\"...um, she was quite explicitly NOT crying due to pain...draw your own conclusions.)   \n",

Now my daughters are each demanding one - and I intend to use several designs in a quilt. I am using them as they are presented in the book, but also the author has explained how to change the pose/wings, etc., of a particular fairy if you want to. The fantastic variety of detailed designs in here are simply beautiful, I see many stitcheries being made, straight from the book. Easy to trace due to the size, too - always a bonus. I will probably use them in applique as well, perhaps enlarging some.   \n",

This was the first Christie that I had ever read, and I absolutly LOVED it!! Keep in mind, though, Christie is a master at writing, and you really have to pay attention to what's going on or you could easily get lost...or miss a clue! As soon as I got done reading it , I told my mom that she just had to read it also. She gave it a try, but she gave up after the first few pages because she thought it was confusing. She missed out on one of the best mysteries ever because she gave up. PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP! It will all start to make sense! I read this book in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. I am now going back and reading it again because I didn't get the full effect reading it so fast. This is beyond doubt, Christie's VERY BEST!!!!!!! PLEASE READ IT!!!!!   \n",

If you were expecting hearts and flowers and violin music, you just don't know Gor! Try instead whips, chains, cages, humiliation, degradation, brutality, and rape. Nevertheless, as hard as he tries,... Clitus Vitellius is unable to suppress his tender feelings, so unbecoming to a Master of the Warrior Caste, toward pretty little Judy. This is the second of the Gor novels to be told from the perspective of an abducted Earth girl enslaved on Gor. Judy aka Dina aka Yata is nowhere near the nasty piece of work that Elinor Brinton of Captive of Gor was. Also, she accepts her slavery much more readily than EB so you would think that her experiences on Gor would not be as harsh. Wrong! This book differs from Captive in several other ways. For one thing it actually has a plot. Unbeknownst to Judy she carries an implanted message to a Cosian agent of the Kurii that has bearing on the interplanetary struggle for control of both Gor and Earth. Of course, after an initial taste of this plot it stops for the next 300 pages or so in order to give the reader a look at what life is like for a slave girl on Gor. If your interest is Gorean lifestyle, you'll like this part. Otherwise, it can be slow going. Another difference from Captive is that there is a fair amount of action especially in the last 150 pages when Tarl Cabot again shows up as Bosk of Port Kar. (Rask of Treve briefly shows up again as well.) The revelation of Judy's hidden message sets up the next novel; however, there is nothing here that seems crucial to understanding subsequent volumes in the series. This is clearly a better novel than Captives but not as good as the action-oriented books.   \n",

In other words, the book could have been about half the amount of pages. The author kept repeating the same thing. Once I got to the section on how to do it - it was great.I totally agree with the concept... no reason to wait until after 2 to start training. My son is 19 months old and loves going on the potty... I figure in a few months we'll be potty trained!   \n",

When Kit Tyler reaches Wethersfield she thinks it gloomy and a dreadful place compared to her former home the wonderful Barbodos Islands. Here the only real refuge she can find is at the old Quaker woman's house.

This recent printing, however, takes the beloved classic a step further. Interlaced onto the pages are facts, trivia, and inspiration, enhancing the reading of the classic. The \"insight\" brings humor and knowledge to the page - giving historical facts to help the reader understand the context, showing humor in an otherwise vague passage, and giving movie references (from the many cinematic versions of the story). A Jane Austen fan will definitely enjoy this \"insight edition\" of one of her classics.   \n",

As a result the reader is presented with a skilfully crafted novel in which setting, character delineation, acute observation of social interaction, accuracy and realism are all very important. The early novels were characterized by the use of irony, humour and satire. These are much less evident in Persuasion, as Austen seemed more concerned with the sympathetic and sensitive expoloration of her heroine's character and situation. Persuasion is a simply structured novel, for its plot is concerned only with bringing Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth together. A major theme of the novel is Austen's examination of pride and vanity - pride in one's social position and vanity of one's personal appearance. The idea of persuadability is tied up with another major concern of the novel - the right quality of mind. As the novel develops, Austen strives to achieve a right balance between contrasting opposites. I started to read the book reluctantly (as it was for school); but when I was familiar with the characters and the language, it was very enjoyable. If you have ever been in love, or thought yourself to be, or even had a crush on someone; you will identify with Anne Elliot's behaviour when she is around Captain Wentworth. It was amazing how real the characters came to be, and the events which occured can be compared of those today. I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in love stories. It was the first Austen book I have read, and it will not be the last.   \n",

I bought it specifically for the Mariner's compass patterns and for directions on how to do it without foundation pieceing. Theere was a lot of information on how to make patterns, but all of the examples and projects were not true Mariner's compass, they were odd variations. And most of the directions were for foundation piecing, in which I was not at all interested. The flying geese borders and info on circular borders was fine, but the stuff on Mariner's compass, for which I purchased this book, was not at all helpful, or inspiring, especially for someone such as I, who wants to hand piece and hand sew the antique patterns. I wish the author (or whomever) had been more explicit in stating that these were modern variations on tradtional themes.   \n",

It's amazing how skillful she was at writing dialogue, even at a younger age. I mention her youth because it pervades Northanger Abbey; the characters are youthful in spirit, and I think that of all her novels, this one might be the most accessible to the modern day younger reader. It was certainly one of my favorites as a teenager (though the pleasure of rereading it hasn't diminished as I've aged). The simple and natural emotions of the main character, Catherine Morland, would seem more real to many of today's teenagers than the repressed spirits seen in so many novels of this period. Catherine is perhaps the least 'civilised' of Austen's leads, in that she does little to conform her behavior to the decorous standard of the day, but she has an exuberance and sweetness that breathe life into every scene, and I think this carries the book. Northanger Abbey is a delightful read for all ages and Austen fans, even the most serious.   \n",

At the age of 22 I read it. I read this book after reading a large numeber of new age and transcendal lit., such as the celestine prophecy, Dr. Dyer's books, Castaneda, etc. And I cried and I was filled with joy. I was elated to have read such an allegory, when the time was right for me to read it. I believe that we, as friends, parents or siblings, should not &quot;force&quot; this reading onto anyone, but maybe just mention it, and allow for every person to choose the right time to read it, be they a child, adolescent or an adult. I live in a city on the Adriatic coast, and there are many seagulls, I often watch an meditate on their flight, and wonder if Jonathan is watching over me. Bach inspires a Jonathan in me!   \n",

Think Mars whereever it says moon, and accept the story for what it is - a story about people with a mission, to which they offer their whole lives, how they make choises that make an impact on their futures, and how easy it is for the idealist with a dream to loose the main target because of the choises made by the &quot;serious investors&quot;. It is (as most of Heinleins books) a tribute to the american way of life, which he always described as the best there is, but even then it is worth reading for those of us &quot;unlucky&quot; enough to live elsewhere.   \n",

It gives you the basics and teaches you things to look out for. I like how the author split the faculty search into different sections, going from the basics of academic institutions to helping you understand what to look for, how to prepare, and finally how to go beyond landing your dream job. Ideally, these books are best read in the year just prior to graduation, or even earlier. It is great overall!   \n",

I was entranced by the imagery and pagentry. I have read it several times since then and have been trying to share it with my children. I highly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys fantansy and history.   \n",

I have read seven of his books so far and my favorites so far, and one of my all time favorite has to be the stand. Sure it isi a lillte week at the end but I find that with alot of his books, and that doesnt mean the rest is junk because of it. Others say it is too long, but it just gives you more room to become familiar with the people in theh story.. With this indepth knowlege of the people draws you more into the story. This is truely one of the great stories of the last 50 years, but I would like to know when we will get the rest of the story. I am a hobby writer; I write little nothings, not because I would like to be a novelist with my works being published and bringing in the big money, but because I like to do it in my spare time, and I can control who reads it and who doesn't( most times its only me) and I have a few ideas for a sequel.... I wonder what you guys think, or ever what Mr King would say.........   \n",

I have been a fan of LL Cool J since his first song Radio. I read the book in one day (8 hrs to be exact) I just couldn't put it down. I felt his joy and pain. I just can't believe what his father but most his stepfather did to him. His &quot;Father&quot; song is the best. I love that song. It just makes you think that there are a lot of people out there, but he overcame it all. He wanted to be somebody and be the best that he could. I commend you for being a good great rap artist, a husband and a father. I love you LL Cool J and I hope to one day meet you. It has been one of my dreams and I hope that one day it comes true. Keep it real baby. Love ya Annette S.   \n",

I have her on my Kindle (28 and counting) but I have her paperback and this book in hardcover as well.I love the everyday hero. He's a soldier who happens on a boy tending the gate at night in bad weather. He's kind to notice the scared boy left to tend the tollgate. His father's gone and the boy's alone and visibly afraid, of something. The mystery begins.The hero is looking for something since he's left the military and found civilian life pales in comparison. His relatives, though well meaning are a bit stiff. He meets the heroine and she is caring for her elderly grandfather, and the weak willed nephew who will inherit his property is again in trouble and hovers like a vulture creating a part of the mystery.So,Captain Staple becomes more drawn into the problem, he meets a goodhearted highwayman who has been kind to the boy and Captain Staple unravels the mysteries; where is the boy's father, why are the shady relatives of the heroine hanging around waiting for her grandfather to die, and what happened to cause a Bow Street Runner to show up in the area. Great plot, interesting characters, and a very comfortable read.   \n",

Although the old English was a little difficult to wade through, we decided that we are really glad that times have changed and that finding a husband should not be a woman's total goal in life, and finding someone else a husband should be totally off limits.   \n",

Whie my kids were sking, I had the chance to read the book once. Then twice with my eldest son, and the third time with my youngest. Each time with a different perspective, which option to choose for a new house, a new car, a new education, a new career and so on.

Having read everything every written by Deborah Crombie, Sue Grafton, Elizabeth George, P.D. James, Alexander McCall Smith and a few others, the Maisie Dobbs series is one of the best I've found in years. Dobbs is part sleuth, part mystic, part philosopher and part psychologist - truly an unusual and intriguing combination. The book is full of insights that I pondered long after finishing the story.   \n",

Some reviewers lament this style of book because it preaches simplicity and because the author actually uses canned broth. That's the point of this book! I like to cook and when I have a chance to pore over the cookbooks and make something really special, I do it. But in the general course of life, I needed somone to point to the things she points to in this book. First, everyone should learn to cook with what they have, not the other way around. Too many people shop for the ingredients to match the recipe rather than what looks good. Second, too many people rely on 'prepared foods'(frozen dinners, etc.) every night of the week because they are busy - but how hard is it to fire up a pan and saute some chicken? Once you get that far, a pan sauce is pretty easy work (and she has a lot of great ideas in that area). Finally, this is good food. No, you will not see a recipe for rabbit livers simmered in cognac, but is that what you really want to make and eat every day? If so, go elsewhere. If you want a book to give you confidence and direction in becoming a good home cook (and I mean better than most people remember their moms to be) then buy this book. If you think you will not have any 'gourmet' flair with a simple book like this, I believe you may be surprised. I was talking to someone about a recipe I was making one time, and they commented that 'when you start talking about sauces, you start talking about gourmet food.' That is certainly a wild overstatement, but the confidence you will build with saucing your entrees will certainly raise the bar above what most people are eating in their houses these days.   \n",

I usually like mysteries.I am not a romance novalist fan, but this was the best book that I have ever read. I read it in only two nights. I laughed so hard I almost woke up my family.If there ever was a book to forget all your troubles, this is definately it!Buy it, you won't be disappointed!   \n",

While reading this novel, I felt a real familiarity with the two main characters, Grimm and Jillian. She really gets into setting up the background (but doesn't pound it - background info, that is - to death like so many other authors do, so much that you want to put the book down right then) for her characters so that you feel like you know them personally. You can really &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; the characters' emotions and the conflicts going on between them. I have to say that it's so very easy with Karen Moning's writing style to get totally caught up and lost in the story line. When I read her first book &amp;quot;Beyond the Highland Mist&amp;quot;, I didn't think that a romance novel could get any better. Boy was I wrong.

       "0  I absolutely adored Karen's new book, &quot;To Tame a Highland Warrior&quot;. It was a book that I truly could not put down. Karen writes in such a way that &quot;bam&quot; she grabs your attention in the very beginning and pulls you right into the story itself. While reading this novel, I felt a real familiarity with the two main characters, Grimm and Jillian. She really gets into setting up the background (but doesn't pound it - background info, that is - to death like so many other authors do, so much that you want to put the book down right then) for her characters so that you feel like you know them personally. You can really &quot;feel&quot; the characters' emotions and the conflicts going on between them. I have to say that it's so very easy with Karen Moning's writing style to get totally caught up and lost in the story line. When I read her first book &quot;Beyond the Highland Mist&quot;, I didn't think that a romance novel could get any better. Boy was I wrong. This novel, in my opinion, far surpasses the last, which like I said above, didn't think could get any better! I really loved everything about her latest novel - especially the way she grabs your attention from the start and keeps it the whole way through! Can't wait to read her next one!   \n",

I have since re-read it a number of times, and each time it reveals more of the nuance of character inherent to the individual hill-williams Mr. Harrington profiles in this classic novel. Having lived in Arkansas since the age of 11 I felt as if I'd grown up with many of the characters he portrays. If you enjoy ludicrous situations and quirky characters read this book NOW!

Doig puts words together in such a mannerthat they make complete, correct English sentences. Thisalone makes the book unusual in modern-day fiction. Then,he grabs your attention with a spellbinding story that hasall of the elements that make you want to begin reading andnever stop. His beloved Montana comes to life such thatyou can hear the constant wind, feel the biting cold, tastethe dust of the dry years, smell the sheep pens at shearingtime, and see the vast expanses of prarie fading into theimpossibly rugged mountains.This book grabbed me by the throat and wouldn't let go.Even long after my last reading of it, I am still moved bythe passion and power of the story. It is certainly amongthe best fiction I have read.   \n",

The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition.   \n",

       "0  i absolutely adored karens new book quotto tame a highland warriorquot it was a book that i truly could put_NEG down karen writes in such a way that quotbamquot she grabs your attention in the very beginning and pulls you right into the story itself while reading this novel i felt a real familiarity with the two main characters grimm and jillian she really gets into setting up the background but doesnt pound it background info that is to death like so many other authors do so much that you want to put the book down right then for her characters so that you feel like you know them personally you can really quotfeelquot the characters emotions and the conflicts going on between them i have to say that its so very easy with karen monings writing style to get totally caught up and lost in the story line when i read her first book quotbeyond the highland mistquot i didnt think that a romance novel could get any better boy was i wrong this novel in my opinion far surpasses the last which like i said above didnt think could get any better i really loved everything about her latest novel especially the way she grabs your attention from the start and keeps it the whole way through cant wait to read her next one  \n",

       "      <td>70 years have passed since the first publication of &amp;quot;A Room of One's Own,&amp;quot; and yet we have not seen as many dramatic changes, let alone improvements, in social mentality as early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf wished to provoke to establish women's new role as equal to men's. She argued that the reason why there was no female Shakespeare is not that women are biologically inferior to men but that there was simply no &amp;quot;room&amp;quot; for women to develop themselves, both metaphorically and realistically speaking. Therefore, in this book she encourages women to have a room of their own and a stable income to ensure a career. However, women, in the past as well as the present, have long been &amp;quot;grounded&amp;quot; by men. For a woman to have a room of her own and a stable income means that the woman is invading (from male chauvinistic viewpoint) men's territory, and this kind of behavior (and thoughts) is not to be allowed in male-dominated societies.Early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided later generations with iron-cast proof (as far as I'm concerned) that women are no &amp;quot;second sex&amp;quot; by pointing out the false discriminations men put against women for men's own convenience. (Ironically, I see men suffer as well from doing so.) Thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided &amp;quot;rooms&amp;quot; to develop feminist thoughts, and these rooms also provoke controversies and debates because feminist way of thinking is revolutionary. At any rate, there would be no improvements of women's role in society if there were no Virginia Woolf and other first-wave feminist thinkers.At the end of the twentieth century, in spite of the burgeoning &amp;quot;industry&amp;quot; of feminism, the real condition of women appears to be quite depressing. The real condition of women goes like this: &amp;quot;During the last decades women's representation in education has grown enormously but so has our [their] participation in low paid and part-time work. So that, for example, the percentage of women in German higher education has doubled yet the degree of confidence German women express for women in non-traditional jobs is one of the lowest in Europe...,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;similarly feminist literary criticism has created a lively and substantial body of work in the last decades but continues to exist in a hostile and often marginal academic place.&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Feminist Literary Criticism&amp;quot;, 1994: 290) One cannot fail to see (if one is willing to open his or her eyes) that we have made just a tiny bit of progress since the first-wave feminism. There is room for improvement, indeed, but people's ignorance of women's real position in society, women's subordinate educational, economical, and political conditions, and the overall social status of women being secondary, must first be recognized. In this sense, Virginia Woolf's &amp;quot;A Room of One's Own&amp;quot; appears to be especially inspiring.In my opinion, feminism is not only for or about women, it is also for and about men, because the world is composed of both sexes, and men suffer (without understanding, because of stupidity) from the traditional, male chauvinistic attitude as well. What is important is that feminist way of thinking is a breakthrough, revolutionary philosophy that challenges the way we perceive the world for centuries. &amp;quot;A Room of One's Own&amp;quot; opens my mind's eye; it is, no doubt, a classic that must be read.</td>\n",

Without getting into a debate on the reasons why we went to Iraq or the reasons why we are still in Iraq it is none the less interesting to note the recruiting (and retention) crisis the military is experiencing in recent years. If being in Iraq and re-making the Middle East in our image is so important to our national security and well being on par with World War II and the Cold War as the neo-conservatives state, then our government should act the part. We need to have a draft where young men of draft age are eligible for a military draft. Not only should we draft our young men but we should draft our money as well in the forms of higer taxes a la WWII. Sadly Bush, the neo-cons and the American people know this won't sell. Even the most ardent Iraq War supporters would turn against it if they or their family members would be put in the line of fire. Before you are willing to kill you should be willing to die. Too many Americans are not.Bearing this context in mind you have an economic draft where those within our society are funneled into the military with over blown and often false promises of education, job skills, and most basically a job. I knew that the recruiters often made false and misleading promises to intice young men and women into the military. I did not know that a contract with the military is a contact where only one party is bound by the terms of the contract (you) and the other party can change the basic terms of the contract at will (the military). Would you enter into a contract with an employer, a partner, a bank or a contractor with such lop-sided terms such as these? Unfortuantely too many young Americans are doing just that. They do not have legal training in contract law to know what they are signing away when then sign the bottom line. Of course some people would chose to deny this fact and others while not openly admitting to this fact wouldn't care less due to the fact those that are trapped in these circumstances look different from them and come from the other side of the tracks.I could go on about the other reasons they mentioned but I will stick to this point. Two things I fault the book on is the fact they didn't mention that the military can call you back into service disrupting your life and career many years after your initial service to serve in a war you may not agree with. Another fact they failed to mention was the chicken-hawks (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, DeLay, Limbaugh et al) who are so eager to start wars but so hesitant to go to war themselves.Like I said read this book for youself and then decide. The Pentagon has a multi-million dollar budget to promote recruiting, why should it fear one book?Robert</td>\n",

Truly one of the greatest and most demanding books you'll ever read, the story not only involves the reader, but makes you feel for and with the characters and the ending which is the climax and best part of the book is indeed an emotional strain and feel for the characters. I'll even dare to say you'll enjoy every page of this book, because I know I did. The beginning is a bit slow but still very engaging and different events and characters only add to the splendor of the work. Indeed this is a very good and well-written novel, and I openly say that there would be no regret if you were to read this book, a novel that pleasantly surprised me and for that, I enjoyed it greatly.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I don't think Lewis meant to &amp;quot;preach to the choir.&amp;quot; He knows that many fine people deny Christianity because they think its a naive and silly belief. Lewis understands the skeptics mind and speaks directly to it. He isn't an entrenched, Christian Theologian, he is a normal man who speaks planely. In fact he almost always prefaces his books by downplaying his own knowledge of Christian Theology. This make Lewis very approachable, yet intellectually sound.Unlike the other reviewers, I am not a Christian and I have read and enjoyed this book. Lewis was a die-hard ATHEIST before he became christian. He was a brilliant intellectual and made the leap of faith, not because he got hit on the head, but because he objectively analyzed the Bible. His background alone puts me immediatley at ease when I read him. He won't try to manipulate the facts to push you toward Christ. He just lays down his ideas, with nothing up his sleaves and lets you make of it what you will. Unlike many Christian apologists, he knows that you can't be forced into Christianity (God Knows Many Have Tried).Skeptics, myself included, should read at least some of Lewis. I suggest Mere Christianity as a primer and then The Great Divorce. If you are a responsible intellectual, unsatisfied with other &amp;quot;Christian&amp;quot; apologies, and looking for concrete answers concerning the Christian Faith, it would be foolish to ignore Lewis.</td>\n",

Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense &amp; Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride &amp; Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen.</td>\n",

I found myself thinking that my seemingly enormous trials are tiny in comparison to the life of an abandoned and rejected street lad in southern Africa. The writing is concise and clear and leads the reader through this remarkable life story in no time flat. I couldn't put it down!

There were many people who would have offered support to the Dell'Olio family had we been able to contact them. The author must realize that a teenager was murdered, it was not an accidental death, it was murder. The author seemed to be trying to make himself out as the hero. I doubt that he found Andrew Dell'Olio as easy to approach as he states in his book. This book was difficult to read because of the many grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. It appears it was not professionally edited.

The host asked him what 12 books of the Bible he would bring if he were stranded on a desert island. \"Well, I certainly wouldn't bring Leviticus,\" was the theologan's reply. That is the case with many Christians. To them, many of the Old Testament books \"just aren't important,\" but they ALL are still the word of God.George Knight gives us a very readable and practical commentary on the book of Leviticus (a manuel for Israel's priests and a \"Holiness Code\"--moral commands--for the people). The book consists of a half-chapter (give or take) of Scripture followed by Knight's commentary. Knight often gives some very insightful commentary showing what this type of animal sacrifice shows about God's personality or explaining why the people could only have one type of crop in a given field.Although Knight succeeds in making a normally dull book (especialy when compared with Genesis, Joshua, 2 Samuel, the Gospels, etc) seem exciting, there do exist some faults with the book. One chapter in Leviticus deals with rules agains homosexuality. Instead of coming right out and saying what he believes Leviticus says about the subject, Knight tip-toes and tap-dances so much, I'm still not really quite sure WHAT he believes about it. I'm not sure if he's delicately trying to say that God is wrong about gay folk or if he's just a little afraid to actually condemn homosexual practices.There are other places in the commentary where Knight does a similar tap-dance routine, but overall, this is an extremely good commentary that really aided in my understanding of Leviticus.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Humphrey Van Weydon is an affluent gentleman living in San Francisco during the early 1900's. Because of his inherited father's wealth, he hasn't had to work a day in his life, has gotten a first class education, and spends most of his time reading and discussing the latest novels. One foggy day as he travels across the bay to visit a friend there is a collision, and he is cast into the sea. After being rescued, he discovers that he is aboard a seal-hunting ship bound for Japan with a cold-hearted captain. This captain, known as the Sea Wolf, has no respect for Humphrey's money and decides to keep him aboard to be used for work in the galley. The Sea Wolf also has no respect for life, viewing it as fermenting yeast with the most brutal aspects of natural selection in play. He is a self-educated man and talks with Humphrey about life, philosophy, literature, et cetera. London describes their situation as \"relations...between king and jester.\" A gripping tale set on the high seas, this book will keep your eyes locked on Humphrey's changing life, and the Sea Wolf's deadly ways.I recommend this book because many things are taken for granted in today's rich American society, not least of which being the ability to stand on your own two legs. Most of the modern population depends on others for survival, and this dependence has made us weak. When Humphrey Van Weydon begins to stand on his own he goes through a considerable change, as most people do when faced with a crisis. This change can make or break someone, but like the old adage goes, \"whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\" While this story is filled with suspense and amazement, the intriguing philosophical concepts arouse your mind and keep the gears turning. The Sea Wolf is an excellent novel, a classic in every sense of the word, and one that teaches much about the human struggle for survival and self-improvement.</td>\n",

For Jane Austen, that book was \"Mansfield Park\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \"Mansfield Park\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\"Mansfield Park\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Truman Capote's In Cold Blood is a milestone in American non-fiction literature. As a part of a class project at UCLA, my history studies class was divided into three groups tasked to develop a trifocal analysis. We focused on Capote's book, the recent movie In Cold Blood, and the 1967 film of the same with Robert Blake. The book is something much more than a contemporary true crime tale; it's a vivid and disturbing case study of a viciously murderous crime that brings the events and subsequent murder trial back to life decades later. It comes as no surprise to me that this book turned Truman into a literary icon.Truman's book originally published in 1965 was a derivative of several articles that originally appeared in the New Yorker. The book is a true account of the vicious and cold blooded murders of the Clutter family who resided on a farm in Holcomb, Kansas. Capote reconstructed the events in chilling detail, the investigation leading to the arrests, the trial and final executions of the men who committed the murders. His violent literary documentary was reined by the New York Times as the most important book ever written on a singular event of American violence. The book was said to have been such an emotionally exhaustive experience that it became his last published work until he died in 1984. The book is an absolute must read for anyone reading American crime subjects.I also recommend as a supplement to this account watching the original epic film with Robert Blake now on DVD. The entire movie was filmed on location in both the farm house and the court room where the men were tried for murder and then sentenced to death by hanging. If you spend a week immersed in these three media works, you will forever be affected by the terrible murders, and also moved by the stories of those they affected. Another thing I found chilling was the idea that Blake would be tried for murder in real life decades later. We spend a week looking through Capote's spyglass and interpreting the actions of all involved.You can't experience the coldness of these crimes without reading the book by Capote in his own words. I highly recommend not only the book, but also the companion films. Please also see my other reviews on other great books.</td>\n",

Secondly, it seemed like Heyer repeated herself quite a few times in the 100+ pages I did read, and I found myself skimming paragraphs of dialogue that I felt I'd already read.For those reading Heyer for the first time I'd recommend one of her other books, like Sylvester, The Nonesuch, or Frederica.

In _A Cook's Tour_, Bourdain actually goes to Vietnam and to Cambodia in search of food. I'm uncomfortable from the very start. The first sentence refers to \"those not-so-adorable scamps, the Khmer Rouge\"--\"scamps\"!? Are we also going to talk about those \"rascals, the Nazis\"? Authors of one of the terrific holocausts of the last century...Bourdain's cultural deafness is ever striking; he goes so far as to suggest that the US involvement in Vietnam was part of a lovers' quarrel (he thinks Vietnamese women are beautiful). Bourdain's tone is, of course, ironic, but I, for one, don't think he can get away with irony in such cases. His books are worth reading, but with caution. The metaphors can kill you.</td>\n",

At that age I was not too discerning, I cared nothing for characterization, dialogue or prose. I read only for fun and escapism, not for the artistry of the works. Well, I am way out of my teen now, and I have cultivated an appreciation finesse to compensate for my own deficiency in that department.Since her recent passing tributes have been pouring in for Anne McCaffrey from numerous quarters, including major sf/f writers including Neil Gaiman, David Brin, Lev Grossman, and Vonda McIntyre. These tributes reminded that I never really gave Anne McCaffrey's books a fair chance. Now is as good a time as any to start exploring them in earnest.When I first heard about this series decades ago the idea of fighting threads did not fill me with enthusiasm, I mean fighting threads? May as well fight balls of yarn! I thought. Ah, but then there are threads and there are Threads, these things are more menacing than I ever gave them any credit for. They are basically mindless, true, but so are zombies and the threads are even more deadly. They burn and they burrow and they are of course relentlessThis is not a YA book, it is not action packed, those looking for heart pounding scenes of dragon conflagration are not likely to be satisfied. The major strength and enduring popularity of this book - and I imagine the entire series - is the immersiveness of Pern. The slower chapters depicting day to life on Pern is what makes the world realistic, after all life is not full of nonstop action on a daily basis. The author wants you to live with her characters not go on missions with them. That said she really makes you wait for the threads to make an appearance though!This is also not a fantasy book, not in the sense that Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time are. Anne herself has always been adamant that she is a science fiction author, no disrespect to the wonderful fantasy genre of course, but she deliberately backed the Pern fantasy tropes of dragons and medieval life with science. Pern is a planet, the dragons are genetically engineered and the lack of technology is due to some event that caused a fall of technological civilization. So no magic, no elves, no unicorns and no Dark Lord with a funny name (thank gawd!). The author's meticulous attention to details is awe inspiring.Anne's prose style is - as her legions of fans would attest - is beautiful, clean, clear, concise and literary. The main characters are skillfully fleshed out, unfortunately my one complaint is that the protagonist Lessa is unrelentingly ill-tempered and willful to the point of being a pain in the posterior. I am looking forward to many more visits to Pern.\"That was well flown, I say. Well flown\".RIP Anne.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Atticus Finch strikes me as an attorney who loves the law, loves practicing law, recognizes its value and import in our everyday lives (literally, in some cases), and has become disillusioned by the astounding lack of adequate preparation by law schools of law students for the practice of law.At first, when I read PLS, I took a lot of his diatribe with a grain of salt. My first eye-opener was discussing my imminent experience with a friend's husband, who had not read PLS (hadn't even heard of it) - a practicing attorney for the past 12 years. Through the course of our conversation, he confirmed everything I brought up that I had been skeptical about in PLS, in terms of what you actually learn in law school, how well it prepares you to practice, and even to pass the bar.Before I came to law school, I taught for five years at the collegiate level, and can attest to the fact that law school (likely, professional schools in general) is NOT similar in the \"feel good\" attitude toward education as at even the largest undergraduate institutions. HOWEVER, fortunately it has become more difficult for people to get away with \"bad behavior\" (e.g., racist or sexist attitudes publicly expressed), so it is likely your experience in your law school may APPEAR much more benign than described in PLS. Just BEWARE of what lies underneath that surface. Reading PLS will help to prepare you psychologically for what will amount to an assault on your personality and sensibility.After my first semester of law school, I honestly wish I had thoroughly prepared last year according to one of the several syllabi provided in PLSII. Get this book, read it, follow the advice in it! Get the study aids, choose the longest prep syllabus you have time for, and follow it.You DO need to prep for law school. And you need to read PLSII and put that weapon in your arsenal.</td>\n",

History is not about great sweeping flows and the tidal forces of social and economic change but about people, about individuals, and what they made of the world they encountered. This book explores the American century through a thoughtfully-chosen group of individuals: the film stars and criminals, the spies and generals, the preachers and bankers, the dreamers and the dissidents. And the author takes us from the particular to the general, putting those deeper social forces into the background where they belong. I never knew that modern US aviation depended on William Boeing not only for his airplanes, but because he also founded United Airlines. I never knew that evangelist Billy Graham was such an intense political animal, or that John Steinbeck was suspected of communist subversion by the FBI, or that Richard Nixon was by most counts a liberal politician, or that Emma Goldman tried to raise funds for the revolutionary cause as a prostitute. I had also never thought about Bill Clinton in such historical terms before, nor realised that the real revolution for American women was economic rather than erotic. Beautifully written, this is a book full of delights and information, that will make you think about America while it keeps you greatly entertained.</td>\n",

The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades, rather than a contiguos moving story/time line.

       "0   70 years have passed since the first publication of &quot;A Room of One's Own,&quot; and yet we have not seen as many dramatic changes, let alone improvements, in social mentality as early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf wished to provoke to establish women's new role as equal to men's. She argued that the reason why there was no female Shakespeare is not that women are biologically inferior to men but that there was simply no &quot;room&quot; for women to develop themselves, both metaphorically and realistically speaking. Therefore, in this book she encourages women to have a room of their own and a stable income to ensure a career. However, women, in the past as well as the present, have long been &quot;grounded&quot; by men. For a woman to have a room of her own and a stable income means that the woman is invading (from male chauvinistic viewpoint) men's territory, and this kind of behavior (and thoughts) is not to be allowed in male-dominated societies.Early feminist thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided later generations with iron-cast proof (as far as I'm concerned) that women are no &quot;second sex&quot; by pointing out the false discriminations men put against women for men's own convenience. (Ironically, I see men suffer as well from doing so.) Thinkers like Virginia Woolf provided &quot;rooms&quot; to develop feminist thoughts, and these rooms also provoke controversies and debates because feminist way of thinking is revolutionary. At any rate, there would be no improvements of women's role in society if there were no Virginia Woolf and other first-wave feminist thinkers.At the end of the twentieth century, in spite of the burgeoning &quot;industry&quot; of feminism, the real condition of women appears to be quite depressing. The real condition of women goes like this: &quot;During the last decades women's representation in education has grown enormously but so has our [their] participation in low paid and part-time work. So that, for example, the percentage of women in German higher education has doubled yet the degree of confidence German women express for women in non-traditional jobs is one of the lowest in Europe...,&quot; and &quot;similarly feminist literary criticism has created a lively and substantial body of work in the last decades but continues to exist in a hostile and often marginal academic place.&quot; (&quot;A Reader's Guide to Contemporary Feminist Literary Criticism&quot;, 1994: 290) One cannot fail to see (if one is willing to open his or her eyes) that we have made just a tiny bit of progress since the first-wave feminism. There is room for improvement, indeed, but people's ignorance of women's real position in society, women's subordinate educational, economical, and political conditions, and the overall social status of women being secondary, must first be recognized. In this sense, Virginia Woolf's &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; appears to be especially inspiring.In my opinion, feminism is not only for or about women, it is also for and about men, because the world is composed of both sexes, and men suffer (without understanding, because of stupidity) from the traditional, male chauvinistic attitude as well. What is important is that feminist way of thinking is a breakthrough, revolutionary philosophy that challenges the way we perceive the world for centuries. &quot;A Room of One's Own&quot; opens my mind's eye; it is, no doubt, a classic that must be read.   \n",

Without getting into a debate on the reasons why we went to Iraq or the reasons why we are still in Iraq it is none the less interesting to note the recruiting (and retention) crisis the military is experiencing in recent years. If being in Iraq and re-making the Middle East in our image is so important to our national security and well being on par with World War II and the Cold War as the neo-conservatives state, then our government should act the part. We need to have a draft where young men of draft age are eligible for a military draft. Not only should we draft our young men but we should draft our money as well in the forms of higer taxes a la WWII. Sadly Bush, the neo-cons and the American people know this won't sell. Even the most ardent Iraq War supporters would turn against it if they or their family members would be put in the line of fire. Before you are willing to kill you should be willing to die. Too many Americans are not.Bearing this context in mind you have an economic draft where those within our society are funneled into the military with over blown and often false promises of education, job skills, and most basically a job. I knew that the recruiters often made false and misleading promises to intice young men and women into the military. I did not know that a contract with the military is a contact where only one party is bound by the terms of the contract (you) and the other party can change the basic terms of the contract at will (the military). Would you enter into a contract with an employer, a partner, a bank or a contractor with such lop-sided terms such as these? Unfortuantely too many young Americans are doing just that. They do not have legal training in contract law to know what they are signing away when then sign the bottom line. Of course some people would chose to deny this fact and others while not openly admitting to this fact wouldn't care less due to the fact those that are trapped in these circumstances look different from them and come from the other side of the tracks.I could go on about the other reasons they mentioned but I will stick to this point. Two things I fault the book on is the fact they didn't mention that the military can call you back into service disrupting your life and career many years after your initial service to serve in a war you may not agree with. Another fact they failed to mention was the chicken-hawks (Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, DeLay, Limbaugh et al) who are so eager to start wars but so hesitant to go to war themselves.Like I said read this book for youself and then decide. The Pentagon has a multi-million dollar budget to promote recruiting, why should it fear one book?Robert   \n",

Steinbeck has a fluidity to paint with words, to illustrate the subjects, their emotions and their settings with such tenacious cadence that, although it sounds clich&eacute;, one feels as if he/she is there.This particular novel is about many different characters living in a city near San Francisco and follows some of the moments in their lives. What is timeless and splendid about the stories is how they come together and intertwine, and how the characters interact.Pick this book up if you want to go for an imaginary vacation to the Northern coasts of California 50 years into the past....   \n",

He uses metaphors and beautifully written prose instead of complicated, dull, discursive, scientific jargon. Instead of describing this subject from a strictly left brain approach his writing is from a whole brain perspective appealing to both the artist (or in my case musician) and the scientist. He takes physics to the brink of philosophy and beyond in an effort to describe the physics of the universe in spiritual terms. I tried to read _A Brief History of Time_ by Stephen Hawking a few years ago and didn't get past chapter four. After the education I received from Zukav in _Wu Li_, I was able to read and comprehend almost all of _A Brief History of Time_. Give it a try   \n",

The story of two young and love struck individuals with a war all around them, and all they have is each other. Truly one of the greatest and most demanding books you'll ever read, the story not only involves the reader, but makes you feel for and with the characters and the ending which is the climax and best part of the book is indeed an emotional strain and feel for the characters. I'll even dare to say you'll enjoy every page of this book, because I know I did. The beginning is a bit slow but still very engaging and different events and characters only add to the splendor of the work. Indeed this is a very good and well-written novel, and I openly say that there would be no regret if you were to read this book, a novel that pleasantly surprised me and for that, I enjoyed it greatly.   \n",

It was writenfrom the eyes of Jo, the tom boy. There are 4 sisters. Jo and Amy havea temper tantrum. Mr. March is away working. A rich neighbor has a grandson that all of them get to adore one way or the other. It is written in a classical way, which is rare these days. I hardly ever give books a 5, but this time is an exception. END   \n",

This is very emotional book, and I did cry, but it all came together in the end. One of hte best I have ever read.   \n",

Lewis understands the skeptics mind and speaks directly to it. He isn't an entrenched, Christian Theologian, he is a normal man who speaks planely. In fact he almost always prefaces his books by downplaying his own knowledge of Christian Theology. This make Lewis very approachable, yet intellectually sound.Unlike the other reviewers, I am not a Christian and I have read and enjoyed this book. Lewis was a die-hard ATHEIST before he became christian. He was a brilliant intellectual and made the leap of faith, not because he got hit on the head, but because he objectively analyzed the Bible. His background alone puts me immediatley at ease when I read him. He won't try to manipulate the facts to push you toward Christ. He just lays down his ideas, with nothing up his sleaves and lets you make of it what you will. Unlike many Christian apologists, he knows that you can't be forced into Christianity (God Knows Many Have Tried).Skeptics, myself included, should read at least some of Lewis. I suggest Mere Christianity as a primer and then The Great Divorce. If you are a responsible intellectual, unsatisfied with other &quot;Christian&quot; apologies, and looking for concrete answers concerning the Christian Faith, it would be foolish to ignore Lewis.   \n",

It was one of the very first books of its kind, and it had a huge shock value as well as creative value back then. But during the intermediate years from its published date to our present time, the sexual revolution had already made a lot of changes to the SM landscape. Many new theories and techniques on SM literature had been developed since, which in turn had made the ideas and writings in 'the story of O' seem very primative and out of date. My bottom line is that it's not worth awhile to spent money or time on this book unless: 1) you are doing a research on the history of erotica/literature 2) you are an avid collector and want to collect all the erotica writings there is   \n",

They meet alot of strange and unusual characters on there journey. En evil witch turnes alot of the characters in to stone and the kids help get them back. This book isnt realy like any of the books i've read befor. It seems more like a kids book with all of the crazy characters but, people of all ages could enjoy this book.On page 12 of the book, the quote,&quot;How stupid of me! But Ive never seen a son of Adam or a doughter of Eve befor.&quot; This quote kind of lets you know that there are not many humans in Narnia. They refered to humans as sons and, doughters of Adam and, Eve. this book also shows you that even though they are animals they can still talk in english. This is a good book if you like books with unusual characters in it but, i you like serious, or realistic books this is not for you.   \n",

Unfortunately, I found it to be a rather slow read. Everyone who has worked in the industry has stories and many are much funnier and more interesting. Too bad some of those haven't gotten into print.   \n",

It contains about 30 classic Disney stories with beautiful illustrations.The sturdy binding makes this edition perfect for frequenmt use by impatient toddlers. What is more important is that the movie skripts have been skillfully adapted amd DO read like a story. They contain the essential information without retelling the 1.5 hour long features. This also makes the stories' lenght manageable for the attention span of a young kid.   \n",

Crichton lets you the reader know the same things as the main characters, and it is a mystery to the reader just as much to the scientists of the book what killed an entire rural town in one night. The book takes place over a four day period and it only took me 2 days to read it. The book is that quick and good of a read. I don't want to give away what happens but i was just a little disappointed by the end, but it made sense. I really enjoyed this book and i think that it isvery entertaining.   \n",

It enabled me to move through my life since with an effortlessness and awareness that I only dreamed of before reading the book. I picked it up again recently and am still awed by its relevance and insights. The book continues to convey the most brilliant and essential information that we humans need to fully function consciously.   \n",

Upon the marriage of her governess, a match Emma purports to have arranged herself, Emma next turns to finding a suitable husband for her new young friend, Harriet Smith. She encourages Harriet into an infatuation with the vicar, Mr. Elton. Her plans fall apart, however, when Elton reveals to Emma that she is the true object of his affections. Rejected, Mr. Elton flees to Bath and finds a wife almost immediately. When the long-awaited Frank Churchill finally comes to visit, the entire social set of Highbury is swept into a tangle of suspicion, charm and deceit. Although Frank is commonly viewed as a perfect match for Emma, she feels only friendship for him, and views him instead as a potential husband for Harriet. In spite of Emma's multiple failed attempts at matchmaking, there are two couples married and one engaged by the end of the novel.Jane Austen was one of eight children, the daughter of an upper middle-class clergyman. Although her family was not wealthy, they led comfortable, socially respectable lives. Well-educated and with a love of reading, Jane Austen began to write at the age of twelve. She never married. Her first novel, Sense & Sensibility, was published in 1811, followed by Pride & Prejudice. All of her novels were published anonymously. She died in 1817, and is buried in Winchester Cathedral.I found this book to be as charming and delightful as the film, which I first fell in love with long ago. Jane Austen's wit is very much in evidence throughout the novel, and greatly improves what might otherwise be a somewhat dry style. Austen referred to Emma as \"a heroine whom no one but myself will like much.\" However, I found Emma to be engaging and delightful. I recommend this book to all fans of Jane Austen.   \n",

He didn't start that way though and the tale of his conversion from a starving, angry, glue-sniffing, destitute child of the streets to international evangelist, businessman, and devoted husband and father is gripping. I found myself thinking that my seemingly enormous trials are tiny in comparison to the life of an abandoned and rejected street lad in southern Africa. The writing is concise and clear and leads the reader through this remarkable life story in no time flat. I couldn't put it down! And it was on loan to a dear friend the day after I finished reading it. I highly recommend this book!   \n",

And yet, there are a few that are able to survive and become a greater persons for all this deprivation.A story of pain, despair and survival. Highly recommended!   \n",

The authors are well-known and honored environmentalists that lay out the problems and solutions without fanfare. The book contains alot of hard facts in the way of data, charts, and graphs. At several points this created burdensome reading, but it is information of which everyone should be made aware. Take your reading a bit further and investigate the authors. We need more people like them.   \n",

The beginning, as in many books, starts off slow with introducing the characters but once characters start to die on the island, it gets hard to put the book down. I recommend keeping a list of the characters and trying to solve the mystery as you read but I doubt many readers will be able to.   \n",

Only problem is it needs to be converted for computer as most people do not have a typewriter any more. We figured that using a true type font works best. You can adjust the size of the font based on how big you want it to be.All in all it is a good tool.   \n",

We live in the town where this terrible tragedy took place. The author is incorrect in many of his descriptions of the youth in our small upstate town. The generalizations he makes about how our youth spends their spare time applied back in 1992 to a very small close knit group of teens. There were many people who would have offered support to the Dell'Olio family had we been able to contact them. The author must realize that a teenager was murdered, it was not an accidental death, it was murder. The author seemed to be trying to make himself out as the hero. I doubt that he found Andrew Dell'Olio as easy to approach as he states in his book. This book was difficult to read because of the many grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. It appears it was not professionally edited. The errors were so numerous that it would cause the reader to re-read sentences over and over again to try and understand what the author was trying to say. I gave up. I would hope that others in Upstate New York would not purchase this book.   \n",

The audio narrator interprets the most egregious of the lead character's painful baby talk. (an Amazon's audible.com audio book)The two lead characters are painfully flawed and dysfunctional and their abuse, particularly by the father, continuously ladled out to the children is painful and ever present.There is no redeeming value to this story and its characters. It only gets worse, shattering one's hope that things must certainly improve. I finished it based on some of the reviews here, but I wish I had never wasted my time at all with it.The ending is only mildly satisfying.   \n",

It is worth reading. It is worth buying. I wish I had read this when I was younger. This is one book I will give to my children. If I could, I would make this a part of highschool litterature versus many other pieces we were given to read. It is indeed a classic.   \n",

At one point they had a theologan on. The host asked him what 12 books of the Bible he would bring if he were stranded on a desert island. \"Well, I certainly wouldn't bring Leviticus,\" was the theologan's reply. That is the case with many Christians. To them, many of the Old Testament books \"just aren't important,\" but they ALL are still the word of God.George Knight gives us a very readable and practical commentary on the book of Leviticus (a manuel for Israel's priests and a \"Holiness Code\"--moral commands--for the people). The book consists of a half-chapter (give or take) of Scripture followed by Knight's commentary. Knight often gives some very insightful commentary showing what this type of animal sacrifice shows about God's personality or explaining why the people could only have one type of crop in a given field.Although Knight succeeds in making a normally dull book (especialy when compared with Genesis, Joshua, 2 Samuel, the Gospels, etc) seem exciting, there do exist some faults with the book. One chapter in Leviticus deals with rules agains homosexuality. Instead of coming right out and saying what he believes Leviticus says about the subject, Knight tip-toes and tap-dances so much, I'm still not really quite sure WHAT he believes about it. I'm not sure if he's delicately trying to say that God is wrong about gay folk or if he's just a little afraid to actually condemn homosexual practices.There are other places in the commentary where Knight does a similar tap-dance routine, but overall, this is an extremely good commentary that really aided in my understanding of Leviticus.   \n",

Because of his inherited father's wealth, he hasn't had to work a day in his life, has gotten a first class education, and spends most of his time reading and discussing the latest novels. One foggy day as he travels across the bay to visit a friend there is a collision, and he is cast into the sea. After being rescued, he discovers that he is aboard a seal-hunting ship bound for Japan with a cold-hearted captain. This captain, known as the Sea Wolf, has no respect for Humphrey's money and decides to keep him aboard to be used for work in the galley. The Sea Wolf also has no respect for life, viewing it as fermenting yeast with the most brutal aspects of natural selection in play. He is a self-educated man and talks with Humphrey about life, philosophy, literature, et cetera. London describes their situation as \"relations...between king and jester.\" A gripping tale set on the high seas, this book will keep your eyes locked on Humphrey's changing life, and the Sea Wolf's deadly ways.I recommend this book because many things are taken for granted in today's rich American society, not least of which being the ability to stand on your own two legs. Most of the modern population depends on others for survival, and this dependence has made us weak. When Humphrey Van Weydon begins to stand on his own he goes through a considerable change, as most people do when faced with a crisis. This change can make or break someone, but like the old adage goes, \"whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\" While this story is filled with suspense and amazement, the intriguing philosophical concepts arouse your mind and keep the gears turning. The Sea Wolf is an excellent novel, a classic in every sense of the word, and one that teaches much about the human struggle for survival and self-improvement.   \n",

But it doesn't take one long to realize that it is in truth a vicious, vitriolic spewing of the deepest kind of personal hatred of the author toward the Bush family. To have simply documented Bush's gaffes would have been sufficient, but the author insists upon coloring every quotation with inflammatory rhetoric, specifically designed to hurt and offend. If our laws of slander do not cover this kind of pointless animosity, then they fall short of their purpose. If you must read this book, then borrow it or check it out from your library; we do not need to encourage this brand of viciousness by purchasing it.   \n",

I suggest ignoring the footnotes as you read his autobiography since it distracts you from reading Franklin's work. It was a good book that details how industriousness results in a wonderful, useful public life at an older age. Franklin is the type of public servant that we are lacking today.   \n",

For Jane Austen, that book was \"Mansfield Park\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?The biggest problem with \"Mansfield Park\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.\"Mansfield Park\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.   \n",

As a part of a class project at UCLA, my history studies class was divided into three groups tasked to develop a trifocal analysis. We focused on Capote's book, the recent movie In Cold Blood, and the 1967 film of the same with Robert Blake. The book is something much more than a contemporary true crime tale; it's a vivid and disturbing case study of a viciously murderous crime that brings the events and subsequent murder trial back to life decades later. It comes as no surprise to me that this book turned Truman into a literary icon.Truman's book originally published in 1965 was a derivative of several articles that originally appeared in the New Yorker. The book is a true account of the vicious and cold blooded murders of the Clutter family who resided on a farm in Holcomb, Kansas. Capote reconstructed the events in chilling detail, the investigation leading to the arrests, the trial and final executions of the men who committed the murders. His violent literary documentary was reined by the New York Times as the most important book ever written on a singular event of American violence. The book was said to have been such an emotionally exhaustive experience that it became his last published work until he died in 1984. The book is an absolute must read for anyone reading American crime subjects.I also recommend as a supplement to this account watching the original epic film with Robert Blake now on DVD. The entire movie was filmed on location in both the farm house and the court room where the men were tried for murder and then sentenced to death by hanging. If you spend a week immersed in these three media works, you will forever be affected by the terrible murders, and also moved by the stories of those they affected. Another thing I found chilling was the idea that Blake would be tried for murder in real life decades later. We spend a week looking through Capote's spyglass and interpreting the actions of all involved.You can't experience the coldness of these crimes without reading the book by Capote in his own words. I highly recommend not only the book, but also the companion films. Please also see my other reviews on other great books.   \n",

This is a must-read for those who have thought thatthe use of stem cells from aborted fetuses could offer nothingbut advantages. Even those readers with a limited medicalknowledge can readily understand the significance of themessage this book presents.   \n",

I could not finish it. After about 130 pages I figured I had better ways to spend my time and put it down. First of all, the interaction between the hero and heroine was almost non-existent while the mother/son interaction was entirely too prominent. Secondly, it seemed like Heyer repeated herself quite a few times in the 100+ pages I did read, and I found myself skimming paragraphs of dialogue that I felt I'd already read.For those reading Heyer for the first time I'd recommend one of her other books, like Sylvester, The Nonesuch, or Frederica. She really is a brilliant author but, in my opinion, this is not one of her better works.   \n",

This book has a complete set of drawings demonstrating where the energy meridians occur on the human body, but unfortunately this book doesn't teach how to direct Chi along the meridians to clear blockages. This book has pictures that adequately teach a series of exercizes that will improve your health.   \n",

I don't care if we lose the war--we're professionals, man\" (217) are just two occasions for the cooking as Vietnam War metaphor that pervades the book. In _A Cook's Tour_, Bourdain actually goes to Vietnam and to Cambodia in search of food. I'm uncomfortable from the very start. The first sentence refers to \"those not-so-adorable scamps, the Khmer Rouge\"--\"scamps\"!? Are we also going to talk about those \"rascals, the Nazis\"? Authors of one of the terrific holocausts of the last century...Bourdain's cultural deafness is ever striking; he goes so far as to suggest that the US involvement in Vietnam was part of a lovers' quarrel (he thinks Vietnamese women are beautiful). Bourdain's tone is, of course, ironic, but I, for one, don't think he can get away with irony in such cases. His books are worth reading, but with caution. The metaphors can kill you.   \n",

I collect by illustrator, but when I click from hard cover to soft cover I get a completely different edition. They need to list artist and publisher and keep on separate pages. Note when it says item being reviewed, it is not the item I started wanting to get a copy of. Mixed up as usual.   \n",

At that age I was not too discerning, I cared nothing for characterization, dialogue or prose. I read only for fun and escapism, not for the artistry of the works. Well, I am way out of my teen now, and I have cultivated an appreciation finesse to compensate for my own deficiency in that department.Since her recent passing tributes have been pouring in for Anne McCaffrey from numerous quarters, including major sf/f writers including Neil Gaiman, David Brin, Lev Grossman, and Vonda McIntyre. These tributes reminded that I never really gave Anne McCaffrey's books a fair chance. Now is as good a time as any to start exploring them in earnest.When I first heard about this series decades ago the idea of fighting threads did not fill me with enthusiasm, I mean fighting threads? May as well fight balls of yarn! I thought. Ah, but then there are threads and there are Threads, these things are more menacing than I ever gave them any credit for. They are basically mindless, true, but so are zombies and the threads are even more deadly. They burn and they burrow and they are of course relentlessThis is not a YA book, it is not action packed, those looking for heart pounding scenes of dragon conflagration are not likely to be satisfied. The major strength and enduring popularity of this book - and I imagine the entire series - is the immersiveness of Pern. The slower chapters depicting day to life on Pern is what makes the world realistic, after all life is not full of nonstop action on a daily basis. The author wants you to live with her characters not go on missions with them. That said she really makes you wait for the threads to make an appearance though!This is also not a fantasy book, not in the sense that Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time are. Anne herself has always been adamant that she is a science fiction author, no disrespect to the wonderful fantasy genre of course, but she deliberately backed the Pern fantasy tropes of dragons and medieval life with science. Pern is a planet, the dragons are genetically engineered and the lack of technology is due to some event that caused a fall of technological civilization. So no magic, no elves, no unicorns and no Dark Lord with a funny name (thank gawd!). The author's meticulous attention to details is awe inspiring.Anne's prose style is - as her legions of fans would attest - is beautiful, clean, clear, concise and literary. The main characters are skillfully fleshed out, unfortunately my one complaint is that the protagonist Lessa is unrelentingly ill-tempered and willful to the point of being a pain in the posterior. I am looking forward to many more visits to Pern.\"That was well flown, I say. Well flown\".RIP Anne.   \n",

My first eye-opener was discussing my imminent experience with a friend's husband, who had not read PLS (hadn't even heard of it) - a practicing attorney for the past 12 years. Through the course of our conversation, he confirmed everything I brought up that I had been skeptical about in PLS, in terms of what you actually learn in law school, how well it prepares you to practice, and even to pass the bar.Before I came to law school, I taught for five years at the collegiate level, and can attest to the fact that law school (likely, professional schools in general) is NOT similar in the \"feel good\" attitude toward education as at even the largest undergraduate institutions. HOWEVER, fortunately it has become more difficult for people to get away with \"bad behavior\" (e.g., racist or sexist attitudes publicly expressed), so it is likely your experience in your law school may APPEAR much more benign than described in PLS. Just BEWARE of what lies underneath that surface. Reading PLS will help to prepare you psychologically for what will amount to an assault on your personality and sensibility.After my first semester of law school, I honestly wish I had thoroughly prepared last year according to one of the several syllabi provided in PLSII.

Reverend Walker seems to figure this out. Instead of being pushed into surgery by several urologists he undergoes the much less harmful treatment of radiation seed implants. Definitely read this book and note how much pressure was put on the reverend to undergo surgery, while other less harmful options were ignored. The reverend triumphs over his urologists.   \n",

History is not about great sweeping flows and the tidal forces of social and economic change but about people, about individuals, and what they made of the world they encountered. This book explores the American century through a thoughtfully-chosen group of individuals: the film stars and criminals, the spies and generals, the preachers and bankers, the dreamers and the dissidents. And the author takes us from the particular to the general, putting those deeper social forces into the background where they belong. I never knew that modern US aviation depended on William Boeing not only for his airplanes, but because he also founded United Airlines. I never knew that evangelist Billy Graham was such an intense political animal, or that John Steinbeck was suspected of communist subversion by the FBI, or that Richard Nixon was by most counts a liberal politician, or that Emma Goldman tried to raise funds for the revolutionary cause as a prostitute. I had also never thought about Bill Clinton in such historical terms before, nor realised that the real revolution for American women was economic rather than erotic. Beautifully written, this is a book full of delights and information, that will make you think about America while it keeps you greatly entertained.   \n",

The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades, rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book, if you want to call it that, is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov. It's almost a sin to not finish the series which include (in order)foundation and empiresecond foundationfoundation's edgefoundation and earth &lt;-- best book of the seriesTo get most thrill out of the series, i highly recommend reading the robot series (the caves of steel, the naked sun, the robots of dawn, robots and empire) before moving on to foundation's edge and foundation and earth.   \n",
